    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                            so my navigation is kept more concise. I also added my Genshin Impact shrine I got gifted!
                            It's up, but technically I still need to fill out the content.

                            <mark>01/18/26:</mark> I finally got around to adding a drawbox to my page!! It's still
                            kinda rough since I have to do a frame to have it work (something something supporter and no
                            external scripts) and I'll have to organize the submitted art into its own frame eventually,
                            but it is live!! Thank you to the people who already sent in a few doodles 💖

                            <mark>01/12/26:</mark> I completely forgot to actually put this in my feed, I got too lost
                            in the sauce ... I joined Colors TCG on Dreamwidth and ended up using a template for my
                            <a href="cards/index.html">trading page</a>. I'm still very baby with my collection at the
                            moment, and there's still a few things I wanna fix on the page itself (such as having little
                            mini tools which weren't included in the original template but are on the creator's site),
                            and organizing the front page layout but ... Yay, cards! Who is surprised that I'm going ham
                            on collecting Zhongli's cards.

                            <mark>12/25/25:</mark> I finalized the bones for my
                            <a href="shrines/goatlings.html">Goatlings shrine</a>, and in the process the template I
                            wanted to make for it ... as such, err ... my shrine is kinda like half done since I was
                            mostly speedrunning to finalize the template to post up (which it now is on my
                            <a href="templates/index.html">templates</a>!). I still wanna make a goatlings profile tab,
                            but I'd need to figure out the javascript to have a dropdown selection that then populates
                            the template properly with the items ... and that's scary:tm:. <br /><br />Future worry for
                            future me, but for now I should finish my own shrine properly.

                            <mark>12/22/25:</mark> Added a temporary shrine for

                            Service out of the blue. I'll just say it's a shitshow, I'm not gonna summarize it in the

                            format, and added the bigger version in the gallery as well (which obviously is for social

                            tonight as my lil mini goal but uh. Yay pixel art?

                            use one of my own templates; it's not complete yet, I still need to do the gallery and find

                            calculations were wrong. I'll probably expand on it in the future, depending on what
                            questions might come up or if people show interest in the way I did some stuff.

                            In an attempt to try to offload some of my stuff from Toyhouse, I've made my

                            fic section for Yadyra, since I thought he didn't have too much art to explode my skull, but
                            enough to work out a layout ... even so, it still was a lot of work to set up around
                            40&ndash;50 images and to WEBP everything. I'll&nbsp;<em>really</em> need to think about
                            image optimization if I continue with the galleries ...<br /><br /><a href="now.html"

                            Cleaned up my index to reorganize since it's a way to combat the horrible itchy 'aughh I
                            wanna rehaul my site' need. Mostly just added a section for new artwork I do so it's upfront
                            + shuffled things around. New poll as well!

                            CSS code. Also adjusted the index page layout. On a more character end, I finally brought
                            over Sylvie's game kit, cause I realize I never did actually include it in their character
                            page even though it's been fully designed. By extension, I did now finally come up with
                            recommended weapons, artifacts, and teams for them which I did not have before.

                            in my tracking specific sites, I'd like to show off the stuff I've consumed and my thoughts

                            though I'd call it more of an unorganized thought dump. Mostly surrounding me talking about
                            how I view my own identity, and more as something to empty my brain out of my thoughts! It's
                            definitely a more personal blab.

                            written well over ten years ago, but she's one of my more developed OCs I had immensely
                            active for 3&ndash;4 years before she was retired. Had it not been for her, I'd have never
                            met such wonderful people in the OC/Canon community back then

                            mostly added it for days when its hard for even my eyes to focus on the pixel text, so as a
                            simple toggle to Arial which is easiest on my eyes.

                            <mark>04/10/25:</mark> Ughh re-coded the entire site to use a grid system, so it's not
                            reliant on the template I began with. Everything is now properly marked in the CSS + HTML,
                            and it's <i>somewhat</i> responsive on mobile. I'll probably keep just the main content
                            visible on mobile since I haven't figured out how to force the sidebars to re-size to the
                            screen width.

                            to work, so I just used the good old &lt;marquee&gt; code lmaoooo. Added a site button too,
                            so I <i>think</i> I'm done with the barebone setting up for the layouts.

                            gonna be pondering on what to write in it for a good while. Otherwise just CSS mucking
