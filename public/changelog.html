    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        And made <a href="templates/bloggy.html">my second template</a>!! It's in the vein of a tumblr
                        theme (ish), and still pretty simple ... the day I make complex templates I will turn into dust
                        (I don't even think I have any explicitly complex pages on my site). Otherwise, nothing new on
                        the site, I've been bogged down trying to figure out adding carrds to sell on VGen, and it's ...

                        I made my very <a href="templates/boxy.html">first website template</a>!! I hope to make future
                        ones, but I'm a&nbsp;<em>very</em> slow cooker when it comes to layouts and not overthinking it
                        too much<br /><br />On a smaller note, I updated my
                        <a href="diary/index.html">diary calendar</a> to have November settled in

                        Sorely overdue but I added stuff to the #me memes section of my
                        <a href="about.html">about page</a>, with memes I'll probably yoink off my personal tumblr tag.
                        I also added a few new quiz results, and getting an angel from evangelion as my assigned gender
                        is a sickass result

                        Minor changes, but I added
                        <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/resources/code-snippets/">Bechno Kid's</a> cool
                        calendar to the front page (only visible on desktop) and added a little section to link to my
                        <a href="https://zhongvie.bearblog.dev/">bearblog</a> for longer posts, since I'll probably stop
                        adding them to my blog page on here ... which I guess now is more of a microblog!! Bearblog just
                        feels nicer to get full thoughts out on there

                        Not a very exciting <a href="now.html">now page</a> update, mostly just small life stuff, and
                        it's been a bit of a blur. As a more minor thing, I've been doing article reading and wrote a
                        <a href="https://zhongvie.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20/">small blog post</a> on the concept of
                        bookmarks. I also fixed my <a href="articles/food.html">food log</a> page to be a bit cleaner
                        with griddery, and updated some recent foods
                    </p>

                        I ended up caving to make a <a href="articles/food.html">fun food page</a> to just document all
                        the stuff I've cooked and eaten over a period of time; I do not take selfies, I just take food
                        photos LOL. It'll be one of those long-term projects since I need to dig through my phone and
                        just be wary that the id for each 'item' in the masonry grid is different...

                        <a href="articles/website.html">Big ugly code riddled page</a> in trying to break down how I set
                        up my website layout ... at least it was an excuse to actually optimize some stuff in the HTML
                        since there were classes in two separate places ... and some of my layout calculations were
                        wrong. I'll probably expand on it in the future, depending on what questions might come up or if
                        people show interest in the way I did some stuff.

                        In an attempt to try to offload some of my stuff from Toyhouse, I've made my

                        section for Yadyra, since I thought he didn't have too much art to explode my skull, but enough
                        to work out a layout ... even so, it still was a lot of work to set up around 40&ndash;50 images
                        and to WEBP everything. I'll&nbsp;<em>really</em> need to think about image optimization if I
                        continue with the galleries ...<br /><br /><a href="now.html">Now page</a> has been updated
                        w/recent ongoings, though it's a bit of a shorter one since the last two weeks haven't been

                        Cleaned up my index to reorganize since it's a way to combat the horrible itchy 'aughh I wanna
                        rehaul my site' need. Mostly just added a section for new artwork I do so it's upfront +
                        shuffled things around. New poll as well!

                        <a href="https://nanacore.neocities.org/diary">Nana's page</a>, I wanted to make
                        <a href="diary.html">my own little diary page</a> (since I've been in the habit of documenting
                        one highlight of the day in my own actual journal) ... simple, but it's a start!! I've retired
                        the nav link to my listography page, but it's still present on the site itself since I know
                        there's a few outlinks to it

                        been on a bit of a roll with these; after figuring out a nicer way to WEBP convert, the only
                        real issue is just making thumbnails of everything and writing up ALT text for each art piece
                        ... to be fair, 2017 only has 24 art pieces compared to 2016 which had 61. Decent amount of

                        happening so far! Warframe is eating my brain right now so it is on a mild hiatus, but up to the
                        beginning of generation 2 is active (I've also updated <a href="now.html">my now page</a>, but
                        that's a lot smaller)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">08/28/25:</span> Finally added the
                        <a href="recipes/matcha-cookies.html">matcha cookie</a> and
                        <a href="recipes/basa-filet.html">basa filet</a> recipes to my site!! Knocking out more of my
                        greyed out recipes, though the japanese curry one will be a mouthful when I get around to it
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">08/26/25:</span> Temporarily archived my minecraft page, just until I
                        pick it up again and can return to my forever world in full (it's not deleted, it's just in an
                        archived folder that doesn't get pushed to Github). Added a new
                        <a href="blog.html">blog post</a> as well about my new Sims 3 legacy challenge ... maybe if I
                        ever do finish it, I'll make a page here about it (miracle if I ever do)
                    </p>

                        <span class="highlight">08/15/25:</span> Almost 3 weeks since my last update, but my
                        <a href="now.html">now page</a> is caught up to the present; not much has changed outside of me
                        finishing my post-grad and starting to pick up personal projects again
                    </p>

                        <span class="highlight">08/14/25:</span> New <a href="blog.html">blog entry</a> documenting the
                        bentos I've made for myself during my semester! They're all under a 'read more' on the blog

                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">07/31/25:</span> Finally caved to make a new shrine ... it's not the
                        most detailed thing ever, but I wanted to blab about my favourite Bleach character
                        <a href="shrines/ukitake.html">Ukitake</a> and list all the alt cards I got from the Bleach
                        Brave Souls game
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">07/27/25:</span> Updated <a href="now.html">/now</a> and reorganized my
                        index page to add some new webrings. Also changed the front video to one of adef's cool pokemon
                        videos!
                    </p>

                        <span class="highlight">07/16/25:</span> <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> has been updated to
                        2015; I'm working backwards since it's a lot more artwork I need to do in the past vs more
                        recent years, so I'd rather knock them out first
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">07/14/25:</span> Completely overhauled
                        <a href="blog.html">/blog</a> with a new look! I'll be using it for a lot more 'looser' blogging
                        as well. Updated front page video as well!

                        <span class="highlight">07/12/25:</span> New <a href="now.html">now page</a> with what's been
                        going on, though it's a&nbsp;<em>little</em> emptier than some of the other weeks (I did look
                        through my journal and most stuff was either minor life stuff, or website work which I already
                        documented)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">07/08/25:</span> Created an <a href="gallery.html">art page</a>! I
                        finally caved to make one to document my artwork throughout the years, though I'll be curating
                        which ones I add. So far it's only 2025 and <i>part</i> of 2012 and earlier since there's some
                        art I haven't uploaded yet
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">07/08/25:</span> A few changes inbound: I added a full font toggle with
                        different font options, and opted to remove my dark/light mode toggle for the fully built in
                        prefers-system CSS code. Also adjusted the index page layout. On a more character end, I finally
                        brought over Sylvie's game kit, cause I realize I never did actually include it in their
                        character page even though it's been fully designed. By extension, I did now finally come up
                        with recommended weapons, artifacts, and teams for them which I did not have before.
                    </p>

                        <span class="highlight">07/05/25:</span> Added polls to the index page, even though it's fucking
                        <i>ass</i> to set up; thanks to
                        <a href="https://starry-knight.neocities.org/">starry-knight</a> for figuring out how to do it

                        <span class="highlight">06/30/25:</span> Made another
                        <a href="/oc/raiden/index.html">OC page</a>!! Although it's not as fleshed out, he's Hideki's
                        hubby and still means a lot to me even if retired.

                        <span class="highlight">06/28/25:</span> Updated <a href="now.html">/now</a> page again! ... I
                        didn't realize it's been a bit over two weeks since my last update; I wanna try to keep them to
                        a bi-weekly basis for my own tracking as well to look back on for funsies
                    </p>

                        <span class="highlight">06/24/25:</span> Added a <a href="toybox.html">/toybox</a> page to store

                        more as something to empty my brain out of my thoughts! It's definitely a more personal blab.

                        well over ten years ago, but she's one of my more developed OCs I had immensely active for
                        3&ndash;4 years before she was retired. Had it not been for her, I'd have never met such
                        wonderful people in the OC/Canon community back then

                        <span class="highlight">04/11/25:</span> Uhh, added a bunch of stuff ... adjusting my credits
                        page + began a sitemap + did some mobile responsiveness work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">04/10/25:</span> Ughh re-coded the entire site to use a grid system, so
                        it's not reliant on the template I began with. Everything is now properly marked in the CSS +
                        HTML, and it's <i>somewhat</i> responsive on mobile. I'll probably keep just the main content
                        visible on mobile since I haven't figured out how to force the sidebars to re-size to the screen
                        width.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">04/08/25:</span> Marquees beloathed ... no success in getting a
                        javascript alternative to work, so I just used the good old &lt;marquee&gt; code lmaoooo. Added
                        a site button too, so I <i>think</i> I'm done with the barebone setting up for the layouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">04/07/25:</span> Added a <a href="manifesto.html">manifesto</a> page,
                        though uh ... gonna be pondering on what to write in it for a good while. Otherwise just CSS
                        mucking about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">04/06/25:</span> Why is it so hard to decide on a theme ... revamped the
                        entire CSS layout to match closer to my Toyhouse one.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                        <span class="highlight">04/05/25:</span> Made the site ... HTML and CSS spooky, it's been years
                        since I've really went super in depth. Made a <a href="to-do.html">to-do</a> to keep note of
                        what I need ... to do ...
                    </p>
