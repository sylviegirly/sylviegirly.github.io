                        A little place to coalesce all of my tracking items from different sites, though it'll probably
                        be primarily games. <b><u>SPOILERS MAY BE PRESENT</u></b

                        <i>I</i> played them on; most series will be condensed into <i>one</i> entry but special
                        exceptions may be made (usually for games, ex. like the Dragon Age series) or if I feel the need
                        to talk about different parts of it. Inspired from
                        <a href="https://willdotjpg.gay/templates/media/media">will.jpg's media template</a> and using

                        <summary>Understanding the rating system</summary>
                        <p>
                            The idea is that you rate the thing on how much stuff you loved and how much stuff you
                            hated, and those things weight against each other. There's only one way to get 5 stars or 1
                            star, so those should end up as the rarest ratings, wtih 3 stars being the most common.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Spicy' means that the thing inspires emotion, whether positive or negative, while 'bland'
                            means it doesn't affect you much either way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An example of a 3-star (spicy) - for me personally - would be the Twilight series, because
                            there's plenty of garbage in there but also some things that are like crack to me. I can't
                            think of an example of a 3 star (bland) because by nature they don't stick in the mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>(This also assumes giving 0 stars isn't allowed. That'd throw it out of whack...)</p>

                                <p>
                                    There is <u>no</u> way I'm covering all the games, so I'm bundling my thoughts into
                                    one area; I've played the trilogy, the Apollo Justice series, and the 3DS games
                                    (plus I guess the Layton crossover). Although the later games had their own mild
                                    flops and the story felt a lot more meh in comparison to the first 3 games of the
                                    series, the overall series I hold very dearly to my heart to this day.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I can say some of the puzzles did make me feel stupid cause they were convoluted,
                                    but I still had a lot of fun following the weird hijinks and the cases as they
                                    unfolded, even if some felt like they dragged their feet ... I was still invested
                                    alongside the story. I wish I could bring up specifics, but it's all blurred to me
                                    unless I sit down to specifically look through each game and case.

                                    A colourful cast of characters, some with absolutely wonderful storylines (Trucy
                                    beloved daughter!!) and the only fandom that has had me rereading
                                    <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/396317">a fic</a> multiple times in the
                                    span of the decade since I've found it (please please please, I 100% recommend this
                                    fic if you're an ace attorney fan, it's brought me to tears from the emotions in
                                    it).

                                    Phoenix and Edgeworth's "complicated feelings" really left a mark on how I enjoy
                                    consuming relationships in media and has left me craving for the multilayered
                                    exploration between characters that are foils of each other (romantically or
                                    platonically or familial). OTP 4 ever and I'll hold up that

                                    Ah my slide fully into the Age of Empires rabbithole ... I'm not gonna make separate
                                    posts for AoE II and AoE III, since my feelings are overall the same on them as AoM.
                                    AoM just has a more special place in my heart due to the mythological aspects of it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To be fair, I also really liked the story of AoM (and AoE III), and it's one I've
                                    replayed on a number of occasions, even if some of the campaigns really were fucking
                                    hard due to constraits or time limits ... but honestly, to me that's what makes it
                                    fun. I honestly loved going through each mythological land w/the main characters
                                    having Greek characters interacting with those from Norse and Egyptian mythos.

                                    C'mon, are we even surprised this is here? I grew up on Dragon Age, the Choices
                                    game, so of course I was head over heels over a story driven RPG, and one harkening
                                    back to tactical gameplay. Although I am not a big DnD person (I only ever played
                                    3.5e), I really enjoy the combat and all the <u>weird</u> things you can do in it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unsurprisingly I fell for Gale and his soggy, pathetic energy. My first runthrough
                                    of the game took me 60 hours cause I kept exploring every nook and cranny as my
                                    dragonborn open-hand monk. Since then I've done two additional run-throughs as
                                    Sylvie and Nameless (OCs), and an in progress Gale runthrough, and a durge co-op,
                                    and an honour mode runthrough that wasn't all <i>that</i> honourable with mods.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We don't speak how much this poor game has gone through mod hell and how much
                                    suffering I've gone through when new patch updates hit and mess up my entire save
                                    files.

                                    What else is there to say ...? It's a cool original story with two twins that you
                                    take control of (specifically one) and you go through the past (when Kaien used to
                                    be around, with an original captain who helps in raising you), and to the present
                                    storyline. It's really cool to see characters like Rukia and Renji when they used to
                                    be in the Rukon District, or when Urahara used to be captain as well.

                                    The turn-based and character progression system is pretty fun and battles are quite
                                    challenging in some instances, and it's a game I hold immensely fondly to my heart;
                                    it's hard to not lose hours in it. Considering the creation date of it, it only
                                    covers the Arrancar arc, which to be fair I'm kinda glad.

                                    Maybe it's a nostalgia tint that colours it because I grew up with this game, but I
                                    had a lot of fun with it; as someone who deeply enjoyed Fire Emblem's turn-based
                                    grid combat (albeit late in starting with Awakening) and who was/is deeply into the
                                    story and fandom, I had a lot of fun with an original story and characters to
                                    explore alongside familiar ones. I never had much appeal for the other DS games that
                                    were more combat oriented, so it's probably also why I latched more to this because
                                    it was something to take at my own pace.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I do agree it's a pretty barebones combat system, and it moves quite slow
                                    (especially for characters stuck at the 3-4 movement tile range), but it offers
                                    enough meat to chew through in terms of thinking through skill usage and what to
                                    spend your turns on, offering a change-up between the story reading portions and
                                    pondering how to spend your action points during the free time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It's more of a niche title, it'd really require you to be alright with a more
                                    simplistic combat system and to have a decent understanding/enjoyment of Bleach's
                                    world and storyline, but I think it's a pretty neat game.

                                    To be fair I could consider this my first 'souls-like' game since I could not do
                                    Dark Souls 3, and honestly I had a lot of fun even if it was definitely frustrating
                                    at points (I'm the type that I google best builds, pick one I like, then keep
                                    whacking shit when I could try something else).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Allowing customization helped a lot since I ended up making my own OC in it (hi
                                    <a href="OCs/hideki.html">Hideki</a>) so I had the drive to keep pushing forwards to
                                    see my blorbo in cutscenes and take screenshots. I can't say the story is anything
                                    stellar and amazing but it had me hooked through the entirety of it (and had some
                                    neat twists). I think I got almost every achievement but the bad end cause I do not

                                    There's a reason this is considered an RPG classic and we do NAWT speak that I have
                                    150+ hours in this game. Shamelessly completed the highest difficulty even if I
                                    wanted to break my own skull during it (god it was fun). The combat is clunky as
                                    hell, I won't argue, but it really is a strong brain teaser if you like the aspect
                                    of (micro?) managing your team or creating more complex AIs for them. Definitely
                                    would recommend mods though after a vanilla playthrough.

                                    Otherwise what a great piece of dark fantasy and great characters and writing, it's
                                    definitely shaped a lot of my enjoyment of future media.

                                    Y'know what's funny? I actually began Dragon Age with this game, I found Fenris by
                                    complete accident and got enamoured with him, so I got DA2 and played that first
                                    with absolutely zero context of what the hell happened in the first game. Absolutely
                                    the best time of my damn life. I'm a truther for mage sarcastic Hawke and Fenris.
                                    It's rough, the map layout sucks shit, but it had a lot of heart and love in the
                                    character writing and honestly? I loved the combat, it felt so fluid that when I got
                                    around to playing Origins it felt <i>so</i> clunky to me.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    God knows that Chantry scene still lives rent free in my brain and the complete
                                    heartbreak I felt in that moment because I did <u>not</u> know that was coming.

                                    There is a reason this is ranked as my utmost top favourite game on my Backloggd,
                                    and that's because it has a special place in my heart for its characters and my
                                    introduction to the Dragon Age series. Yes also beaten on the hardest difficulty,
                                    surprisingly less annoying than Origins but still a challenge.

                                    Inquisition ... A+ for having Hawke appear, minus for the option to potentially
                                    force Hawke to be lost in the Fade sauce. Either way, I enjoyed the story for what
                                    it's worth, and the Trespasser DLC was really fun!! I did personally go for Dorian
                                    in terms of a romance, and I enjoyed a lot of the new characters + older characters
                                    having major roles within the story itself.

                                    Migrating to such big maps was a ... choice for sure (shudders, Hinterlands...).
                                    Combat was ok, but felt more ... shallow? Than previous entries anyway, I can't put
                                    my finger fully on it since it's been a while since I've completed a full
                                    playthrough of it, but it definitely felt a little <i>less</i> than the previous
                                    iterations.

                                    This ... does not feel like a Dragon Age game to me, in the sense that the combat is
                                    simplified to a point where it doesn't have the tactile feel of the other games, and
                                    the dark tone of the story felt very neutered and watered down; it was hard for me
                                    to take the seriousness of the world-ending situation ... err, <i>seriously</i> when
                                    it felt like the characters themselves weren't. It also feels like to some degree it
                                    disregarded the past entries in terms of story (Ferelden?? Falling to the Blight??)
                                    and all of the work done by the previous protags. Like literally the secret ending
                                    just pissed me off if I'm going to be honest, it feels like it handwaves
                                    <i>everything</i> that has happened in the story.

                                    Perhaps I had too high hopes after a decade, and had to watch them crashing down. I
                                    will say I did enjoy learning a lot more about Solas and his history, and how the
                                    Veil came to be in the first place plus the history of the Dwarves, though it was
                                    funny to get all the memory pieces before we were even allowed to view them.

                                    I can't say I didn't have fun, it was a decent game, it just didn't really feel like
                                    much of a Dragon Age game to me; it may have done better as a spin-off game rather
                                    than being attached to the mainline story.

                                    in 2024 after a decade of playing it (with some hiatuses). In all honestly, if you
                                    strip away all the absolute shitty microtransactions, it's a really fun fast-paced
                                    2.5D action platformer if you like mindless button combos, and really fun classes
                                    and characters. Not great for the wrist, but I had a lot of fun juggling between

                                    was named Asuraid, and the guild I was in dubbed Aid as my nickname that's stuck
                                    since then. So I always have a little permanent mark from this.
                                </p>

                                    As the game progressed, dungeon runs got shorter and more skill spam became the
                                    meta. It didn't detract from the game, though they slowly nuked older dungeons and
                                    streamlined the leveling process to get people closer to the endgame. There were
                                    some raids that happened (Perkisas was fun as fuck, Eltrion was pretty good, and
                                    Drabaki was ... ok), but then they fully introduced a raid system and the concept of
                                    <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="Combat Power">CP</span>, which didn't exist
                                    before. Now dungeons didn't check for how good your items were (item level) but your
                                    total combat power.
                                </p>
                                <p>And honestly I think that's where everything took a downturn slowly.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The raid scene for this game fucking sucks, and progression is tied to raiding since
                                    all the new weapons are locked behind raids. You <u>need</u> to do raids to get your
                                    shitty weapon so you have enough CP to go to the next raid. You <u>need</u> to
                                    upgrade that shitty weapon to the edge of microtransaction dipping hell just so you
                                    can ditch is when you get the next weapon and start from zero all over again.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you're a support class, you can get away with not pouring so much time into it,
                                    but if you main a DPS, you are pratically expected to pour money to improve your
                                    stuff, even if you know you're going to ditch it upon the next raid weapon (and need
                                    to then again pour money into that).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I mained a DPS class, I mained a class that people could not believe could solo
                                    carry DPS raids (and thus needed to either be sub-DPS ... which why would they want
                                    when they can get a main DPS hypercarry ... or duo-DPS with someone of your level).
                                    So I often got overlooked a lot when trying to apply to raid parties, and we had
                                    people need to take me alongside my friend (who was a support class that people
                                    wanted to take along).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyway TL;DR the raid scene burned me out so horribly bad that me and my friend
                                    quit. Love the game, but the community, microtransactions (stupid ass RNG lootboxes
                                    to get outfits that have much better stats), and bloat just absolutely killed my
                                    drive to play anymore.

                                    competing with either NPCs or other local players for points ... really not much you
                                    can go wrong with. They have some really fun minigames (the bug squashing one still

                                <p>
                                    You're better off reading my backloggd review below, since if I talked more casually
                                    about it I'd just fill 5 paragraphs of blabbering. Fandom fucking sucks, Sumeru is
                                    peak, Dendro fucks, and I'm gonna be 30 by the time the storyline is done.

                                <p><b>Backloggd Review:</b></p>
                                <p>
                                    As someone who's been playing since 2020, I can definitely say I do have burnout;
                                    for newcomers, I would recommend the game with the facet of 'new characters you
                                    cannot easily get materials from unless you have a friend who is further in'.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At it's core the game and artistic world design is gorgeous, it has a pretty decent
                                    gameplay loop and isn't as heavily reliant on needing specific team comps or
                                    characters for big pp damage in comparison to games like Honkai Star Rail where you
                                    can't cheese dodge things. In Genshin, if you have decent dodging, you can just chip
                                    damage stuff to death in due time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The story is what keeps me coming back, considering I'm a lore person, and it's why
                                    it's a pretty high star rating for me, though it's marred by gameplay becoming
                                    boring when you've been playing for 5 years now, and tiredness with design choices.
                                    For someone who likes lore and speculation, I def recommend it, but with caveats
                                    that some lore stuff is cucked behind limited events that are now gone (which is
                                    STILL stupid imo, like I'm thankful for the reviews, but it'd be nicer to just give
                                    people the option to experience it themselves).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    (As an aside, as someone who has played
                                    <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="Fate Grand Order">FGO</span> for years,
                                    Genshin is more generous with its gacha than others. It's still shitty and predatory
                                    like any gacha centric game, but trust me when I say in comparison to many other
                                    things I've played, it's on the 'friendlier' side/lesser evil.)

                                <p>
                                    And please mod your game, it makes it so much better to not be blinded by generic
                                    white anime designs, just be careful about being too public about it LOL or like.

                                    Augh, it's so hard to put into words why I love Hades but like ... fun gameplay
                                    where death still has a reward, great story, great characters ... just the fact that
                                    even if you die, you still get new tidbits helps a lot, especially as someone who
                                    played Dead Cells and got frustrated.

                                    I probably won't make a separate section for Hades 2, but I have played the early
                                    access and I know 100% I'll love it just as much as the first game.

                                    I remember as a kid I actually used to wake up before my parents to play this game,
                                    and once I got upset at them inviting me to eat when I was in the middle of a level
                                    ... so to say, I played it, and play it, a lot. Fun levels and a bopping sound
                                    track, though funnily enough I've only ever played it as Jazz, rather than Spazz
                                    (yeah it's a a name, I know) or Lola, but his gameplay is the most comfortable to
                                    me.

                                    Fun run-n-gun platformer with dope level designs (underwater levels still suck ass).
                                    Story isn't all that interesting (oh bad evil turtle guy has bad evil plans).
                                    There's community modding that's still very much alive, and has modded the game to
                                    allow community made levels as well.

                                    I'm sad I never finished this game fully, but it is on my 'to-play' list if I can
                                    get it to work on my Steamdeck; I actually had the disc bundled in a 2-for-1 CD for
                                    the original XBox with some racing game I never played.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The art style and the music are some of my favourite to this day, though I can
                                    definitely say the game was hard for my younger self; collectathons and it's far too
                                    easy to get lost on some of the maps sometimes. Although they do clarify
                                    interactable objects, they do also push your platforming skills to be precise, which
                                    can be hard sometimes with finnicky controls.

                                    I would kill to finish it one day though, cause it's one of those that lives rent

                                    Ahh, this was my introduction into the Kingdom Hearts franchise, considering my
                                    Nintendo DS was truly my first 'console' (albeit I also had a PS2 and OG Xbox later
                                    on), and I can say I adored this game a lot.

                                    So much that I made my own self insert to ship with Roxas LMAO. To be fair, I was
                                    around 12-13 when I first got into it, and was lucky to have friends who were super
                                    supportive in me doing it and indulging my art. I used to be <i>so</i> against
                                    AkuRoku (Axel x Roxas) when I was seeing it cause I was—and to be fair, still kinda
                                    am—protective of my favourite blorbos so I was like 'HOW COULD THEY BE SHIPPED
                                    TOGETHER'. It wasn't even cause they were two guys, I just had my own ship LMAO.

                                    <b>Anyway</b>, self-shipping tangent aside, I really loved the game and the story,
                                    even though I know some people have said the combat feels more ... clunky? In
                                    comparison to other games. Having played a few other Kingdom Hearts games, I can
                                    agree, but it didn't really detract much back then for me.

                                    feelings around the ending of the third game are on the common end of that it feels
                                    ... flat, unflexible, meh. Like I deeply enjoyed myself, and fought to get the
                                    highest rating to ensure Shepard was alive at the end of the &#39;destroy all
                                    mechanics&#39;/red ending, but all the options basically felt like peepeepoopoo by
                                    the end.

                                    Regardless of my gripes, it lives immensely fondly in my heart, so much that I
                                    struggle to replay it because I remember so many of the moments that its hard to
                                    fully relive it again without it being tinged by nostalgia (I did get to live it
                                    through my friend being able to fully play the first game, and she went through the
                                    entire trilogy). Great characters, great story (barring whatever was going on in 3),
                                    great humour. Gameplay is ok, it was clunky in 1 but kinda refined itself in later
                                    ones.

                                    As my feelings are the same around Underground 1 and 2, this kinda encapsulates my
                                    general feeling for the NFS game I have played (I definitely do miss the flexible
                                    customization from those in Most Wanted, but I like the open world aspect a lot more
                                    from Most Wanted vs Underground's).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyway what is there to say? I've lost count how many times I've replayed this game
                                    (either due to losing the save files or because I wanted to). I'm the freak that
                                    keeps my starter car from the beginning all the way to the end (thanks Chevrolet)
                                    and always imagines Yakety Sax playing in my skull when I go in a certain roundabout
                                    just to force cops to chase me. Also zero regrets on the final blacklist member to
                                    push him to the side at the beginning of a race so he smacks into the tree.

                                    Need for Speed unironically was my full introduction into Disturbed as a band, and
                                    got me into more heavy rock and what not. It's also a really, <i>really</i> good
                                    head empty game for me I can lose an hour or two in just racing, so it's a bit of a
                                    comfort food for me. Ironic that I used to be told I'd be a great driver with how
                                    well I played, and here I am with anxiety to drive.

                                    Ahh Perfect World ... probably among the more 'classic' MMORPGs considering its age,
                                    which means level grind fests and instanced dungeons. I really did like its class
                                    system, though it was very much 'if you're female elf you're a healer/mage, if
                                    you're male elf then you're an archer'. To be fair it never really influenced me
                                    much to be gender locked to a class, though I was biased to the venomancer class
                                    (female fox shapeshifter, the male equivalent were big furry tigers) due to it being
                                    a summoning class with pets + was solo friendly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Funnily enough, I didn't play much of the <i>official</i> game, having found myself
                                    locked at somewhere below level 30 because it was immensely grindy + riddled with
                                    microtransactions ... and I went to private servers instead. It's where I played the
                                    game for years on end, and had a great time with the guild I was in. Sadly a lot of
                                    my photos are gone from that era, but when you're not restricted by the level grind,
                                    the game can be really fun ... if not long when you do dungeons (40+ minutes, if not
                                    hours).

                                    The ability to fly around the entire map on a mount, alongside listening to a
                                    <a href="https://youtu.be/hVaF3Huo1CI?t=188">gorgeous OST</a> made it one of the
                                    more calming games where I could just lose time flying around because I want to.

                                    Unfortunately the actual game itself is so full of system bloat now +
                                    microtransactions, so even when I do play private servers, I have to make sure
                                    they're the older versions before they introduced card collection systems + a
                                    central tutorial hub (whereas before everyone started in the main city of their
                                    race, which was different). I do revisit it here and there, but it doesn't quite
                                    have the charm is used to because it doesn't have the community from over a decade
                                    ago.

                                    What can I say about the Pokemon game that I started on? I remember watching a Lets
                                    Play before I even had a Nintendo DS and being so enamoured with Giratina's design,
                                    and I think I remember actually naming my Starly turned Staraptor after that Lets
                                    Player's Staraptor as well. I remember staying up stupidly late to beat Cynthia for
                                    the first time, who gave me such a challenge back then, I remember falling in love
                                    with Garchomp's design, and the Distortion World mechanics of flipping around, and
                                    spending hours on the stupid contests and making poffins for everyone. 10/10 game
                                    would love to wipe my memory and play it again.

                                    I&#39;m bundling the series in general into one post, though I have differing
                                    feelings on all of them overall. For a quick and easy summary: Sims 2 and 3 are my
                                    top favourites, but I&#39;ve played the original and Sims 4 (thanks fitgirl, iykyk)
                                    as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I sadly don&#39;t have much of the patience for Sims like I used to, especially
                                    since my dumb ass got into the stupid mod rabbit hole and got lost in trying to get
                                    mods to work for Sims 2 to have more variety before even getting to playing it. I
                                    mostly use it to fulfil the OC itch scratch and just watch my blorbos interacting,
                                    but I&#39;ve been recently trying to get into challenges to spice things up a bit.

                                    Fun for a little while, and it falls into my &#39;hyperfixate on this for two weeks
                                    straight, then don&#39;t touch it for a year&#39; cycle. EA are greedy cashcows,
                                    it&#39;s <strong>never</strong> worth buying any of the games.

                                    Oh Spore my beloved ... I still have the CDs for the base game + all the expansions
                                    and I remember being on chat with an EA employee to get them added to my EA account
                                    so I could play them digitally ... I cannot count the amount of time I've poured
                                    into this game, especially once Galactic Adventures was released and I got into
                                    playing the usermade adventures (and killing Stanley in so many of those, I even
                                    made one of my own where he gets killed by dinosaurs).

                                    To be fair, I actually never played the first game in the remade trilogy, which is
                                    silly; I began with the second game (The Eternal Night) and played the shit out of
                                    that. Because I didn't have the first game to go off of (and the only other Spyro
                                    game I had was Enter the Dragonfly which ... <i>yeah</i>, really not worth
                                    comparing), I can't say I thought of the combat and puzzles as lesser.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was hard, it was challenging and frustrating at points, but I had a lot of fun
                                    with it, and god knows I listened to the ending OST a LOT.

                                    Dawn of the Dragon really lives as the primary one in my heart though because of the
                                    complete change of like ... bigger Spyro, the ability to play Cynder, gorgeous
                                    graphics and just something that felt so completely different to me. I can't recount
                                    how many hours I've lost just flying around, lost in a mental roleplay and imagining
                                    of scenes. I can't say the story is anything special IMO, actually being able to
                                    fight Malefor was cool as hell but it wasn't anything awe-inspiring.

                                    ... does anyone remember the old online chathub Spyro's Lair? God knows I spent a
                                    lot of time there just dinking around with the minigames and making my own dragon.
                                    There's actually a

                                    Either way, I would like to eventually play the first game just to feel out the
                                    gameplay and get to fight adult Cynder. God knows I've seen more than enough fanart
                                    of her. Make of that what you will.

                                    I grew up on TWEWY, and the OST for it still is among my absolute favourites
                                    alongside Jet Set Radio Future. What can I say, I was a TWEWY girl for the longest
                                    time and funnily enough the ship of Neku and Joshua was what got me into liking
                                    'yaoi' or rather finally not feeling weird as a kid about more queer relationships
                                    (cause I was about 13-14 myself when I first played it and got exposed to ship art
                                    of them and I really liked their dynamic in general as characters bouncing off each
                                    other).

                                    Aside from that, the gameplay? Bomb. Music? Bomb as fuck. Story? Pretty fucking bomb
                                    as fuck. Doomsday on your hand/death game? You can't go too wrong with that. Proof
                                    all along you were killed and had something given up? Bomb as fuck still.

                                    ... to be fair I played that chick as my main character, but honestly I also just
                                    liked her the most out of all the characters, LMAO. Mario Party meets adult and
                                    slapstick humour. Really not much of a story to this, all the characters suck as
                                    people at their core (considering they are designed to represent the seven deadly
                                    sins in their designs/personalities) and are vying to win a gameshow hosted by the
                                    literal devil himself.

                                <p>
                                    Literally not much else I can say, they're very arcade-y game VS modes you progress
                                    through and it can be local multiplayer as well. The maps were super creative and
                                    fun though, and had fun hazards/interactive pieces to them.

                                <p>
                                    Childhood memories ... god knows I have all the expansion packs and still have the
                                    original disks somewhere ... I tried to play Zoo Tycoon 1, but it never stuck with
                                    me quite like Zoo Tycoon 2 did, considering I got easily frustrated with the animal
                                    requirements and honestly, it just wasn't as fun for me in an isometric world. In
                                    comparison, ZT2 felt like it had a lot more freedom with decorating and
                                    personalizing the park and enclosures.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Zoo Tycoon 2 being in 3D and having you take on the role of both a guest and
                                    caretaker was <u>super</u> appealing to me as a kid and I still think it's a neat
                                    concept now. I do not think about how many hours I spent in the dinosaur enclosures
                                    hiding in a nest pretending I was a baby waiting to hatch.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sometimes it is slow, especially during campaigns where you're waiting for things to
                                    happen, or money to gather, or specific things to unlock, so I never really finished
                                    the missions. But I've definitely played the crap out of it enough to say I've
                                    'completed' all facets of it.

                                    about it, but I'll grab the elevator pitch from their post for easy reading access:

                                    My elevator pitch is this: something with the cosmic-scale goofy video game nonsense
                                    and intricate setting comparable to Homestuck in its prime, paired with the deft
                                    emotional poignancy and emotionally-driven fights of Mob Psycho 100, topped off with
                                    the sort of compassionate and heartwrenching metanarrative of Undertale.

                                    First delve outside of the MXTX danmei books and honestly, I've been having a romp
                                    so far with this; truly an enemies to lovers and I'm gleefully kicking my feet in
                                    wondering how these two will get together when one side has sowed such a wide gap of
                                    distrust for him. The political intrigue is really interesting as well, even if the
                                    copious amounts of characters sometimes flies over my head, I do still get a general

                                <p>
                                    Honestly, I’ve mostly been seeing this around on my Tumblr feed and my friend
                                    yoinked me one night for us to go watch it on a whim (though it’s been to our watch
                                    list for a while). What fun animation, what a fun story—even if predictable a bit,
                                    the animation really brought it to life and was so fun to follow along with the
                                    songs and characters. It got laughs and tears out of me by the end, and the songs
                                    were solidly bopping
                                </p>
                                <p>You know it’s good when me and my friend talk very little during it</p>
                                <p>
                                    I’m glad they didn’t pursue a romance by the end, and put emphasis on the friendship
                                    of the three girls by the end; although I wouldn’t have minded a romance, it feels
                                    like it would’ve undermined Rumi’s friendship. Also the aunt was the true villain
                                    all along, seriously if she hadn’t pushed ‘you must hide yourself’ none of this
                                    would’ve happened
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It’s kinda funny hearing the songs from there are topping other KPop bands and
                                    there’s discussion if it could be considered a KPop song
                                </p>

                                    My slip'n'slide into the Transformers hole (like me and many others apparently); I
                                    missed a lot of the callbacks to other TF Shows and comics, but I was enamoured by
                                    the heartaching friendship between D-16 and Orion Pax not knowing the outcome of it.
                                    So you can imagine it's even more heartwrenching after Knowing everything and
                                    indulging further into Transformers media ... 10/10 would rewatch again to have my
                                    heart ripped out (MAKE A SECOND ONE!!!).

                                    aired, but I only remember me re-watching it back in college some years later (and
                                    the art craze where everyone was drawing in the PASWG style).

                                    Transformers parody now that I have both my feet into the fandom (<em

                                    Some of the humour errs on a bit too much for me (the booger centric episode sure is
                                    uh … something), but like 95% of it still makes me cackle laugh to this day. It’s
                                    definitely outdated humour in some places, but on a show about vulgar angels I’m
                                    really not surprised.

                                    I’m so glad to see it back after 15 years and being picked up by Studio Trigger of
                                    all people, they already hit it out of the park with the first episode and I’m
                                    excited to see what else they do for the season 2

                                    As someone who loves intrigue, I am <u>hooked</u> in what's happening, and I love
                                    the details that were put even into side characters, that they're all memorable in
                                    their designs and personalities. Maomao aspec rep icon (even though I know there's
                                    the whole romance aspect with Jinshi she's so like ... <i>girl</i> ...). Good story,
                                    good character development, funny humour balanced out with seriousness, and
                                    characters I adore.

                                    My love and hate fandom for the last decade or so; I got into Bleach when catching
                                    the anime late at night, and eventually began reading the manga itself. Hell, it was
                                    the fandom that got me into making my first true fandom OC and where I was embroiled
                                    in for at least 5-6 years. I love it, but I have many mixed feelings on the
                                    characters and story choices (Byakuya should've died, thematically it'd make so much
                                    more sense), and I'm still stupidly wounded over Ukitake's stupid death and it's why
                                    I'm taking a star off. He deserved SO much better than how his story ended (and the
                                    shock I had when they revealed in a later story that he ended up taking over as a
                                    judge/executioner of hell ... and that's <u>years</u> after the manga was over).
                                </p>
                                <p>Anyway, one of the big 3 from the early 2000's and the bane of my existence.</p>
