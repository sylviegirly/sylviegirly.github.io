                            A bickering, old, married couple would be the simplest and easiest way to summarize their
                            dynamic—and it's what many think of them at first sight, though at the core of their
                            relationship is a foundation of a friendship that has persisted for thousands of years. Both
                            see each other as a friend and equal partner before all else, and bear a deep sense of trust
                            and respect that runs to their very essence, having seen each other at their highest and
                            brightest—and the lowest and ugliest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Interactions between the two come easy and freely as water flows, resulting in either
                            hours-long conversations about the broadest and wildest of topics, or petty back and forth
                            arguments over the smallest and silliest things—often instigated by Sylvie—that ends with
                            both having a chuckle.

                            other for so long at this point that he just feels like a part of my world. Huhu ... my
                            partner, my friend, my mate, all that cheesy stuff. A bully as well, even if many don't
                            believe me! He acts as if I'm the only childish one between us, when he's here frowning if
                            I'm eyeballing any Rex Lapis merch or correcting him on something. Which I'm glad for, after
                            seeing him weighed down for so long in his role of Archon, I'm relieved he can finally relax
                            and joke around, and I can be there by his side when doing so ... even if we both have quite
                            a few things we still need to heal from.

                            side until the last grain of sand drops from the hourglass. Although they can be eccentric
                            in their own unique ways, it would be a folly to assume them to be silly and inattentive to
                            the world around themselves; truth be told, it is a farce more often than not. Though I know
                            all too well that they are quite—and I do mean this fondly—a boorish, childish idiot
                            sometimes. Even so, I wouldn't change it for the world, nor pass the opportunity to tease
                            them for it.

                            A long, long time ago was when these two first met ... a time before the Seven were a thing,
                            before the Archon Wars, and when gods were abundant and plentiful across the land; Sylvie,
                            going as Foras back then, often travelled during the winter months (as they were known to
                            'hibernate' by the people of Sumeru during that time). Their travels brought them to the
                            lush lands of old Liyue, where a certain old god was taking a rest with his majestic
                            draconic tail swaying around. Impulse and curiosity pushed the God of Trees in their feral
                            form to bite into that tail and see how hard the scales were, only to be met with a violent
                            whack to their head by the God of Contracts, Morax.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the childish action earned some bickering between the two and butting of their
                            heads, Foras continued to come around to visit Morax, finding amusement in his bluntness and
                            cracking through his stoic personality. Foras's persistence in coming around on their trips,
                            alongside their eagerness to talk, share their own stories, to spar with him, and their
                            general carefree nature eventually warmed Morax up to their company for many years to come,
                            and to this very day.

                            Friends were made amidst the land of Liyue, and many other places, but the future land of
                            Geo became almost like a second home for the Dendro god, making many roots and ties over the
                            years they visited.

                            The Archon War was not kind on either of them, with many gods at each other's throats for
                            the prized seats in the heavens above, and with people—normal humans—looking to the gods for
                            protection in a time of strife and chaos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Morax had the people of Liyue to protect as gods, both friends and foe alike, fell around
                            him. No time to mourn, no time to think, no time to look at who had fallen on the
                            battleground. Only one wilted Glaze Lily was lost right in his arms during this time, the
                            one loss he was doomed to see with his own eyes.
                        </p>

                            Sylvie had the people of Sumeru under their wing; although not the god of a full nation,
                            they cherished and adored the people that looked up to them. Although they did their best to
                            protect everyone, trees were falling, the grounds were shattering, and no amount of Dendro
                            powers were to keep them isolated and safe. And so, in a desperate attempt to find safety
                            for their people, they tried to get them out of Sumeru, to gods they knew even in the throes
                            of war would still extend a hand.

                            But many had their own issues, many had their hands full, their houses crumbling, to where
                            even their own people were fighting to survive. Others were already dead.

                            Their search for the safety of their people brought them out all the way to Mondstadt, that
                            during then was a frigid iceland and battle between Andrius and Decarabian; Andrius was one
                            of the gods that Sylvie was on relatively good terms with—even if the two disagreed on their
                            views of humanity.

                            But they never even got a chance to reach him, finding their death in the frigid wastelands
                            of Mondstadt, and with their people left behind in Sumeru, unknowing of what happened to
                            their god.

                            In reality, Sylvie had died, but their abilities are rooted in regeneration, which kicked in
                            for the very first time ever with their 'death'; their body was surrounded by enough Dendro
                            to slowly stitch and hold their form back together and to keep it from dispersing violently.
                            Even so, this process took a thousand years, leaving them to slumber comatose under what
                            would be the Windrise Tree in the future.

                            Their awakening brought a wave of confusion, anguish, and hurt; the war had come to an end,
                            and their existence has come to disappear in the history of Teyvat. Who was to know Foras
                            anymore? Did anyone look for them? Were their people okay? Were their people angry? Their
                            death robbed them of themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What was their purpose anymore, if not to be a god? And so, their identity was shed, and so
                            was Sylvie born. Even so, they wanted to seek out the gods that remained.

                        <p>
                            There was relief in finding out that Morax, now under the title of Rex Lapis, was still
                            alive—but there was a distant rift that hung awkwardly over them due to the unspoken loss
                            between the two of them, of old friends, of people they were meant to protect, and more.
                            Sylvie did their best to try to maintain their connection, especially as few gods remained,
                            but the other god kept a large distance between them, coming off tired and with the
                            responsibility of his role as Archon superseding any personal desires.

                            It was frustrating, lonely, and heart-aching, only dulled by the fact that their time was
                            occupied otherwise learning the world of the living, and what it means to be human. But they
                            wouldn't give up on their friendship. Not when they could see how lonely it was in return to
                            be an Archon.

                            The Cataclysm was a catalyst for Sylvie to disappear off Teyvat for the last five-hundred
                            years and into the Dark Sea, their anger towards Celestia too great to remain around the
                            other gods. Although a lonely, and harrowing experience, it helped them in expanding their
                            knowledge and even meeting some new faces they would call friends now. They still lingered
                            on the fringes of Teyvat, catching bits and pieces of news, but not having the courage to
                            return after so many years had now passed.

                            Upon promptly chewing out the other god for his staged death—with massive relief—Sylvie came
                            to find that Rex Lapis was now under a new identity as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor
                            consultant, Zhongli. The name of Rex Lapis was left behind, along with the responsibilities
                            of Archon. Now with ample free time on his hands and no weight to hold him back anymore,
                            Sylvie's warmth was returned, and their friendship was rekindled in full without there being
                            any barriers.

                            Without realization (at least on Sylvie's side in the beginning), their mutual care and
                            connection flourished into underlying romantic feelings that unfurled as the two now could
                            truly live for themselves, with Zhongli accepting his own in full while quietly, patiently
                            waiting for them—because it was not hard to see that they felt the same in return.

                            Sylvie, meanwhile, struggled with their own out of fear of ruining their friendship that had
                            barely just been rekindled. But over time, over the months they've returned, over fleeting
                            touches, compliments that held more than what was said, being welcomed so openly back into
                            his arms and life ... it bubbled up into impulsiveness that made Sylvie take the first
                            action in kissing him—almost causing a full-blown panic at them ruining said friendship—only
                            for Zhongli to reassure them the feelings were shared in full.

                            Alongside following the traveller's journey, Sylvie's return has given both the opportunity
                            to heal and bring some doors to a close. Sylvie's death—unfortunately viewed in full by
                            Zhongli through walking in their dreams—finally allowed him to grieve and acknowledge their
                            death in full, and his heavy guilt in not thinking of them until much, much later.

                            Visiting Sumeru, after many years of avoiding it, brought closure to Sylvie for how their
                            past self and history had been ripped away from them with their death and the conclusion of
                            the war, finally finding enough comfort to call Sumeru their home once more and to be
                            welcomed with open arms by the forest that never forgot.

                            A funeral was held for them, by Zhongli's gentle nudging, to fully say goodbye to Foras. A

                            injury to Sylvie, half of their torso being completely obliterated in the process of
                            destroying an Abyssal demon that was threatening to leak out to the chasm's surface, leaving
                            them bedridden for a month as their body slowly purged the abyssal poison within. Zhongli
                            carefully helped in nursing them back to health, letting Sylvie see his vulnerability and
                            fear in losing them again after he had seen them killed once.

                            it comes off like a proposal. Mm ... I wouldn't have it any other way; I'm happy to call him
                            my husband, even if he is my closest, and dearest, friend first and foremost.

                            <span class="name">Zhongli:</span> I thought it was quite obvious to people that we were
                            together, considering how much we are locked to each other's side ... imagine my own
                            surprise at other people's shock when I told them I was married already while they were
                            amusing themselves about finding a suitor for me. I don't see much need to advertise it, our
                            companionship speaks more than enough for itself.

                                Their primary affectionate pet names/nicknames for each other are
                                <b>𐎠𐎿𐎴 - stone (asan) / my gemstone / my mountain / my sunflower</b> for Zhongli, and

                            <li>
                                That's not to speak of the many nicknames Sylvie has for Zhongli with the mere purpose
                                to annoy him (parched rock, sir consultant, dusty old man, your highness, Rex Lapis
                                (derogatory), etc.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Zhongli has (unfortunately) had Sylvie's terrible humour rub off on him and has laughed
                                at the word boobies—to his own shame and hope that Sylvie never finds out, otherwise
                                they won't let him live it down.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Zhongli often has his accessories stolen by Sylvie just because they want to wear them
                                (namely his hair clasp and earring). This has culminated in him getting gifted a big
                                green bow to use as a hair clasp because they thought it'd be silly.

                                aches and emptiness from giving up his own; little does Sylvie know that they've given
                                him a life-line for them to revive from that piece were they to be killed.
