                            by the name of Foras. Disillusioned with the aspect of godhood upon their revival from a
                            death suffered during the Archon War, they have integrated into human life and have been
                            travelling all over Teyvat for the last 1,500 years.

                            travelling all over Teyvat for the last 1,500 years.

                                lived through, they've grown to be observant of people and habits. although their own
                                knowledge runs deep, their intellect is best shown in reading people and reacting on the
                                spot to situations ... strategizing is not their strong suit, and they tend to prefer
                                thinking and doing in the moment, which has lead to a metaphorical foot in the mouth.

                        <li>
                            That tree was worshipped in old Sumeru for many generations before their birth and well
                            before the archon wars began spreading out; upon Sylvie's 'birth' from it, they were
                            eventually adopted as their guardian to a large cluster of villages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Their feral form is their natural-born form, reaching 13 feet in height and 26 in length,
                            though when born they were the size of a newborn fawn.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although seen as the god of trees due to how they came into the world, their power extends
                            to the surrounding flora; with their powers, they could create strips of land with fertile
                            soil that would be used to grow crops outside the wetness of the surrounding forest. They
                            were often asked for blessings for harvests to be bountiful, or for natural medicines to
                            work on ailments and improving health.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Their main source of trade back then was focused on highly used crops (barley, etc), foraged
                            items, wood, selling of medicinal herbs and spices, and fabric exchange (in either crafted
                            outfits or raw materials), as it was their primary 'currency' ... and mora hadn't come to
                            exist back then as a universal currency.

                        <li>
                            During the dry season when harvests were quieter, they went into 'hibernation', though thhis
                            was mostly a guise to travel outside Sumeru and explore the world that was abundant with
                            different gods. It was during this time they met other gods and beings such as Morax,
                            Azhdaha, Marchosius, Osial, Guizhong, Havria, and more.

                                They were present for the beginning of the archon wars when it began to bleed over the
                                continent of Sumeru, but in an attempt to get help from Andrius to shelter the people
                                under their protection, they found themselves in the snow-covered Mondstadt after an
                                attempt to contact Morax went unanswered.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Unfortunately, before having a chance to get to Andrius, the interruption of another god
                                resulted in them having taken a fatal hit that nearly bisected them, injured from having
                                killed the other god violently.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the short moments before losing consciousness, they buried themselves underground
                                using the roots of the hiberating trees, cocooning themselves underneath the spot where
                                the Windrise tree would soon come to form through Vanessa.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This injury caused them to essentially <em>die</em>, but this is when their regeneration
                                kicked in for the very first time; due to that, the time it took for them to revive and
                                recover lasted around 1000 years, waking up 500 years after the archon wars were over
                                (so 1.5k years before the present time).

                            <li>
                                Due to them being "dead" they emitted no elemental energy and remained practically
                                invisible over their recovery.

                                The general belief was that they had died due to the war after abandoning the people
                                they protected; the grand tree they were born from withered alongside them.

                                After waking up, they ended up chasing down Rex Lapis to find out more information about
                                the current timeline, him being closest god to where they woke up and one of the ones
                                they knew from back then. Foras ended up interrupting a Rite of Descension on purpose to
                                get his attention.

                                They went through different stages of grief and guilt at finding out so many gods were
                                killed or chased off due to being seen as "evil" for not agreeing with the new rule,
                                hearing the belief that they had abandoned their people, seeing that none of their
                                history remined ... this feeling of helplessness and anger eventually made them denounce
                                their own godhood and want to just live as someone else; they had no more identity left
                                after their own death.

                                learn about the new world and how to be human and to forge a new identity, finding a
                                desire to want to integrate among them and learn more about living. This is where they
                                took on the name Sylvatica, which was eventually simplified to <i>Sylvie</i>.

                                as well as relearning their friendship with Rex Lapis due to the vast difference of the

                            They only resurfaced at the notion of Rex Lapis's death a week after the situation, finding
                            their way back to <b>Liyue</b> out of worry and disbelief of the incident occuring (with

                            goal to find their sibling; the drive to push and topple the system put in by Celestia also
                            rests at the back of their mind.

                            During the lock-down of <b>Inazuma</b>, they have snuck to the island, covertly aiding the

                            seeing the trial and how people react to her not being a true 'god' leads them to a deep,

                            died rising up once more ... something sits weirdly in them at the sight, but it is not
                            their place to argue with those coming back (even if they know all too well the trauma that
                            comes with dying and coming back).

                    <p>
                        Sylvie's kit falls under a very standard <u>5-star Dendro claymore DPS</u>, centric around being
                        the main damage dealer and active on-field character; their kit can lean into being a full ATK
                        based build, an EM build, or something of a hybrid between the two of them. They can self heal
                        and can inflict a semi-consistent Dendro application to enemies, though the bulk of their damage
                        comes from their burst (like Arataki Itto).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They do benefit from having a team that has a variety of elements, but they can also work in a 3
                        dendro party with an elemental driver. Full mono teams are not recommended.

                    <h1>Trivia</h1>
                    <div class="scrollable">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sylvie was made on <b>March 14, 2021</b>.</li>
                            <li>
                                Sylvie cannot handle spice to save their life, despite a deep love of spicy food in
                                general; they faked their spicy intolerance so hard it became real.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Their ears are quite sensitive to touch, it may cause them to protectively cover their
                                ears if anyone touches them or breathes close to them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They can eat everything for the most part because their body can digest practically
                                anything (minus anything originating from the void/abyss realm). even so, they are a
                                massive foodie and prefer actual food.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They tend to view grooming (brushing one's hair, etc) as a bonding, affectionate
                                activity, so friends may find Sylvie working on their hair to fix it (or licking it if
                                they're in their deer form).
                            </li>

                                Sylvie has no true human body; they have no organs inside of them and they fake their
                                blood being 'red', in reality, they are just a human bag wrapped around pure dendro
                                essence (thus their true 'blood' is green).

                                any other way to not have someone to go stupidly unhinged with.

                                the touch, Sylvie welcomes the affection.
