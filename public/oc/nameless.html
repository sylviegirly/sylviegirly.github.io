                        <p>
                            A demon among the world of the living ... well, among them only when he's craving his
                            favourite food: <b>souls</b>. With a smooth tongue and charming persona, it's not hard for
                            him to lure in unsuspecting humans with a thirst for something more, for an answer or
                            resolution that he can happily provide ... <b>at a price</b>, of course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He spends his spare time managing the other demons; with his power, he ranks higher than
                            most and many respect him almost to a fault. Some call him a king, along with many other
                            ostentatious titles, but he shrugs them off as he feels no true desire for them — their
                            purpose is merely to survive by the end of it, not to rise up and overtake their food
                            resource.
                        </p>
                        <p>( Though he'd be lying if he said he didn't enjoy watching humans undermine themselves. )</p>
                        <p>
                            To those willing to deal with the devil (or just talk to him), he makes a wonderful
                            conversation partner; millenniums of living have given him a vast depth of knowledge and
                            experience to discuss, though one still has to tread carefully with him.

                            resolution that he can happily provide ... <b>at a price</b>, of course.

                            He spends his spare time managing the other demons; with his power, he ranks higher than
                            most and many respect him almost to a fault. Some call him a king, along with many other
                            ostentatious titles, but he shrugs them off as he feels no true desire for them — their
                            purpose is merely to survive by the end of it, not to rise up and overtake their food
                            resource.

                            To those willing to deal with the devil (or just talk to him), he makes a wonderful
                            conversation partner; millenniums of living have given him a vast depth of knowledge and
                            experience to discuss, though one still has to tread carefully with him.

                    <p>
                        The deep, pale depths of this kingdom only knew my heels, and no others that weren't my cloned
                        army.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I built this place to suit me, and <i>only</i> me. I see countless painted murals, all showing a
                        different version of me. My <i>eyes</i>, my <i>darkness</i>, and my <i>elegance</i>. My purity
                        in the shadows. I walk across halls that only have my wonderful and flawless face across it all.
                        My strength won me the throne of all the Hells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I smile as I see my throne, and breathe in the room deeply as I push further in, alarming the
                        living throne, that I would soon be sitting on it. The throne itself is very alive—adorably
                        waiting for me—because there's not much it can do, but sit there. Of course, anyone else who
                        isn't me, will die upon sitting on the thing. I remember testing it, putting a poor pathetic
                        demonic on it who was all too busy stammering its pleas, and then <b>pop</b>! It was splattered
                        everywhere on the floor, on the walls, on me, yet the throne was as clean as if it didn't
                        happen!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried with another demon, and another pop. Slower this time. The screaming of agony upon the
                        realization, and the incapability to move from said throne, made me laugh. Watching them choke
                        as the blood from their throat started to rise and spill out, and they slowly cracked and split
                        too. Cruel. But as fun as that was, I decided to stop doing so; it was <i>oh so</i> very messy,
                        and I don't have time to enjoy such slow torture all the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Someone needs to grow this hell, so I take my seat, and see the extreme pale lady residing from
                        within. She looks at where I entered from, glaring for a moment, then not staying anymore. She
                        was the one who I bent to my will, regardless of how she felt about me. I broke into her, and
                        now I owned her. She disliked me, but I don't think she ever liked anyone, and that doesn't
                        matter to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things were clean now, the bounds of hell no longer a fight for one to survive. It's a fight to
                        win favors from <b>me</b>, otherwise you'll die in a delightfully painfully manner, which I
                        often choose. People screamed, begged for mercy where there was none. For their hunger to
                        survive was strong, but they were stupid and eager little <i>pigs</i> that didn't understand the
                        greater point of it being my Hell. And only <b><i>my</i></b> Hell.
                    </p>

                        You <b>bow</b>, <b>obey</b>, and <b>listen</b>. &mdash;

                        <p>
                            You could call him many names, King of Demons, Ruler of the divine Evils. All of them to be
                            true, but to be called one title is flat out boring. His joy to play with human life in
                            itself, that alone the definition of demons to a human minded fellow. He doesn't care,
                            however. It's simple, people can call him whatever they want, but he knows the truth of
                            himself and the other demons that fear him with respect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To put simply who this man is, the one who rules over your simple nightmares, life ends with
                            him in a situation of humans if he's involved. His smile is like that of snakes locking onto
                            a simple mouse before it strikes at the neck, choking it and stealing its last breath for
                            pleasure. His words the viper's venom. But sometimes... the price was worth it, for what
                            they wanted. Since a demon won't lie to you, but also won't tell you the truth of what you
                            signed up for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A mastermind of despair, someone who wants the equal value of his work, of course. What
                            demon do you know works for free?
                        </p>
                        <p>But what if they try to flee without payment? Become rats or be content?</p>
                        <p>
                            Eyes float around him, laughing and mocking the victim after they got what they wanted, and
                            didn't want to pay the price. He laughs at them, gives them time to see if they can flee.
                            But of course, they can't. It was hilarious to see many tries, however.
                        </p>
                        <p>But what can create something so dark, so unruly?</p>
                        <p>
                            It's very simple. Human desire is as dark and hateful as it is bright and lovely. You can't
                            live truly without either. You have desires, your neighbor has desires. You have hate, as
                            does someone else. Human desires birthed this dark soul, and human desires bring forth as
                            the years go by. He knows he was born from a devil's egg in an unexpecting village that
                            homed a murderer, whose soul so dark... gave birth to a demon that destroyed the whole
                            village overnight.
                        </p>
                        <p>A feast just for one.</p>
                        <p>
                            It was, delicious, one by one, another meal, another after another! How could he dare forget
                            that feeling? It was so filling, but now the feeling sometimes become bland, and he's very
                            picky about who he chooses to "help" now. The soul is richest when it's desperate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But whose that desperate to call the King himself? Only he knows that's the answer, and he
                            can't wait to see the next rat that becomes his victim. He's waiting, knowing, they will
                            show up one day... and he will be as devilish ready as he could be. &mdash;

                            A demon amongst demons ... demons are often born of tainted and corrupt souls, but few are
                            just
                            <i>born</i>, made of raw and pure darkness and void. Nameless is one of those very few, a
                            demon in all his fullness. But even he needed to start from the very bottom, scraping what
                            morsel of souls he could get his hands on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But with time comes practice, and with practice things get easier. His tongue got smoother
                            and sharper, his patience slowly lengthened to where he would be happy to patiently wait
                            ten, twenty, if not a hundred years of a meal if need be. Soon, even longer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the realm back then, it was a dog eat dog world, everyone fended for themselves and
                            'alliances' were forged wearily; your allegiance was often to yourself, even if you said
                            differently. Survival was a goal, yes ... but some had their sights set much higher, to the
                            throne governing the entirety of the demon realm.
                        </p>

                            ... he wished he had a grandiose tale on how he came to take it, but by the end, it felt
                            like child's play to merely sit on the throne and have it take to his whims.

                            His primary power lies in shadow and spatial manipulation which makes travelling easier for
                            him around the area; transitioning between the world of demons and humans to him is the
                            equivalent of an easy flick of the hand. His raw physical strength is well above the average
                            human and most other species within the world, having the ability to tear and unearth trees
                            if he so wished to.

                            He also has the ability to shapeshift and take on any form he so wishes; the current one is
                            one he created for himself to keep as an appearance, but in reality demons are forever
                            shifting in what they look like, with no true form of their own besides what they choose to
                            look like. He's always found the elder and younger appearances to be the easiest to use if
                            needing to scout or interact with humans.
