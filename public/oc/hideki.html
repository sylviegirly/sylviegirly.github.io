                            Hideki is a towering 6'4" tall man with albinism who is living in Japan with his husband, is
                            primarily a streamer and works part-time at his uncle's café. He also runs a Youtube channel
                            about games on the side; cosplaying and doing make-up for others are core hobbies alongside
                            gaming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He is soft, expressive, and optimistic at his core, with a heart that's too big for his own
                            good; he is sensitive to the emotions of those around him, and he tries to see the best in
                            everyone, sometimes offering help at the cost of not helping himself. Of course, over the
                            years he has worked on that, but the desire to do right sometimes triumphs logic. Just know
                            that he is a friend who will be by your side through thick and thin.

                            Hideki is a towering 6'4" tall man with albinism who is living in Japan with his husband, is
                            primarily a streamer and works part-time at his uncle's café. He also runs a Youtube channel
                            about games on the side; cosplaying and doing make-up for others are core hobbies alongside
                            gaming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He is soft, expressive, and optimistic at his core, with a heart that's too big for his own
                            good; he is sensitive to the emotions of those around him, and he tries to see the best in
                            everyone, sometimes offering help at the cost of not helping himself. Of course, over the
                            years he has worked on that, but the desire to do right sometimes triumphs logic. Just know
                            that he is a friend who will be by your side through thick and thin.

                                which comes through. perhaps some see it as naivete, but after the life he's lived, he
                                tries to live by the golden rule of treating others how they treat you.

                                himself in discussions, but if you find the right topics to discuss, he can actively
                                blab on for hours over his interests, namely games, ongoing internet events, and the

                        <p>
                            Hideki was raised in a household where his parents were workaholics, and he often spent more
                            time alone than around any other person. He was a socially awkward child, often preferring
                            to lock himself in his room and to play on his consoles, finding it hard to interact with
                            other children without some degree of anxiety. The most consistent interaction he had with
                            other people was with babysitters that changed yearly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first 5-6 years of his life were a vicious struggle between his mother and father; his
                            mother had always wished for a daughter and tried to mold Hideki into that desire, while his
                            father did everything to stop that. In the end, he succeeded, but it lasted long enough to
                            leave a permanent mark on Hideki&#39;s sense of identity. The relationship between him and
                            his mother was anything but loving; she chided him over small things, never offered the
                            attention he needed, put him down, and unknown to him, his father was, unfortunately, victim
                            to her as well. She held the finance of the family and had him under her thumb, so he was
                            unable to leave or take Hideki away. His father genuinely loved Hideki, but he didn&#39;t
                            have much time to spend with him, and he walked on eggshells around his wife.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This all had changed at the age of 5 when his mother became pregnant with another child and
                            when he was six, she gave birth to a young girl bestowed with the name Hitomi, what his
                            mother had wanted all along. The albino became next to non-existent to his mother, rather
                            giving the young girl the attention he never got &mdash; and he grew jealous until the young
                            girl turned her attention to her big brother and wanted to genuinely spend time with him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was a struggle between him and his mother over her, but his father always made sure
                            they found time for each other. Hitomi grew to be his best friend, helping Hideki open up
                            and become more sociable and giving him someone to lean on for a bit when he didn&#39;t feel
                            well. She was his light and he would protect her with his life if he could.

                            It was during this time that he had also met Haru and Raiden Lemarchal, two twin brothers
                            that were stopping in the Edogawa district in Tokyo with their father. They were roughly
                            around Hideki&#39;s age, only older by almost a year. It took a while for him to warm up to
                            them, but with coaxing from his sister and Haru they all grew to be relatively close,
                            leaving the young albino to be ecstatic to have found people who wouldn&rsquo;t ignore him
                            or drop him due to being a hard person to befriend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He leaned more towards the quiet twin, Raiden, due to the other having some kind of presence
                            that Hideki didn&#39;t mind ( silences between them never really felt awkward ).
                            Hideki&#39;s favourite thing to do was to get Raiden to smile, even though that was next to
                            impossible &mdash; the smiles he did squeeze out made every &quot;accidental&quot; bump over
                            objects and scraped knee worth it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He lead a relatively happy life, despite his parents and the trouble he got in at school
                            when it came to fighting; he had his sister by his side and a small friend group that was
                            tight-knit for a good handful of years. It was at the age of 15, when his sister was 9, that
                            everything changed.

                        <p>
                            He had lost his sister to a car accident when they were out one summer day: he had been
                            holding on to her hand when something ahead caught her attention. Against his protests, she
                            slipped out of his grip, running ahead through the crowds &mdash; over the noise she
                            didn&rsquo;t hear the oncoming car, soon succumbing to internal bleeding on the way to the
                            hospital. Hideki&rsquo;s mother ended up blaming him for her death while his father stayed
                            silent, leaving the albino to gain a neurotic guilt complex that heavily weighed him down
                            for many years. Around this time his own powers manifested when his anger and stress spiked,
                            often blowing out lightbulbs or causing erratic patterns to appear on the screens of
                            electronics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Haru and Raiden also disappeared not long after, leaving him alone. The albino had never
                            learned how to properly cope with his emotions from a young age, and often got overwhelmed
                            by his own feelings and was in a constant emotional turmoil. His anger often lashed out
                            towards his parents or other kids at school if they provoked him; he wouldn&#39;t waste time
                            pouncing on someone if they insulted him and he often came home bruised and hurt, even more
                            so than before. At moments he went out himself to seek trouble, people to fight just for the
                            thrill of it, pain, and the violent outlet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He had grown to have a dependency on oxycodone to drown out his emotions after he had
                            suffered an injury and had to be on painkillers. He had contemplated ending it all by taking
                            his own life with an overdose of them, though he always ended up backing out on any attempts
                            or spitting out the pills. He went through a total of three attempts with the painkillers,
                            not counting the four others across his lifetime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Things changed when his uncle whom he had never officially met, James King, came to visit
                            one day from a distant town and stayed over for a few days. He and Hideki got along almost
                            immediately and the albino latched to him, not long after he left and after a few weeks of
                            digging up information online and from his father, Hideki had decided to run away from home
                            and to where his uncle lived, bag packed for a new life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though surprised, his uncle took him in and eventually became the father he never had truly
                            had from the beginning. He finished high school in Karakura and settled into his life
                            helping at his uncle&rsquo;s cafe ( Cafe Latte ). James had also helped Hideki wean off his
                            dependency upon oxycodone, and he tried his best to offer Hideki emotional support &mdash;
                            and to this day Hideki is thankful for everything his uncle has done for him.

                                move to Japan. Originally James had decided to make the jump to move to Japan to try to
                                help both his brother and his nephew. )</b

                    <p>
                        Hideki continued living under his uncle&#39;s care, having finished high school and remaining to
                        work as a waiter in the cafe his uncle had owned for a few good years now. He was in a better
                        and healthier place for his own mental health, but life at the time was dull and things were
                        lackluster; pain was still some way to feel something and he still sought it out in the privacy
                        of his room with a roll of bandages by his side. Anger still flared up in small doses and his
                        knuckles ran raw with the times he&#39;s taken it out on his surroundings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He met Raiden again one night in the cafe and the two reunited ( albeit they acted awkwardly
                        around each other ). He met the girl Raiden shared an apartment with, Saki, and the albino began
                        to branch out to meet other people, such as Llewella, Aurora, and Rafael, friends who had helped
                        Hideki out when he wasn&#39;t feeling well and gave him support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The albino struggled with helping himself, and having Raiden back, he wished to help his
                        childhood friend with the troubles he was having, leading to frequent arguments and heated
                        moments between them as Raiden pushed him away and Hideki tried to push closer, threatening to
                        break the two apart. It took a long time until the ravenette allowed Hideki to get close, and
                        even longer for the two to officially be considered together. Ups and downs followed, events
                        that left the both of them hurt &mdash; but also helped to develop them, and eventually the two
                        got married in France on June 3, 2015.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He got help for his own self through therapy, although it took a while to find it in Japan.
                        Hideki is a lot happier with himself now and content, having put most of his past behind him and
                        learning to look forward to the future. He still has moments where he becomes his own worst
                        enemy, but he knows he has the support and aid to help when those times come around. There is a
                        lot more confidence in his own identity and self and he&#39;s starting to branch himself out to
                        different interests and events to try to create memorable experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, he is living in a house he and Raiden share. He often visits his uncle with Raiden,
                        and still works as a waiter at the cafe, taking it upon himself to educate new employees and
                        including himself in most tasks in the cafe; it has done wonders to help him open up over the
                        years and to smooth out his turbulent personality from the past. On the side, he handles a
                        youtube channel centered around breaking games in fun ways, and does streaming as a hobby with
                        quite a decent following. His relationship with his father, although still uneasy, is slowly
                        starting to heal now that he has separated from his wife&mdash;Hideki&#39;s mother.
