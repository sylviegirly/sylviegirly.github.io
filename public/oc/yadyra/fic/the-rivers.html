                        The logic of the water flow of life and death where one is the flow to the depths is understood
                        by many and yet still a mystery. But some could say that is the beauty in it, or some could say,
                        there's no beauty in the mystery of death. The white field of flowers death laid below the pink
                        river flowing river of life, Ahaur, the ancient god of primal death, looked above, they held no
                        envy for the flow of life, nor jealously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just pure understanding and awe of the beauty above. But there was no denying, they adored life
                        to a high degree. It seemed like fun, they had experienced it a few times before, though, but
                        getting back to present thoughts, the god of death sensed someone looking down at them from
                        above the waters. They looked up.
                    </p>
                    <p>"Greetings, Ahaur." Said a very familiar voice, one that they found soothing more in time.</p>
                    <p>
                        "Hello, Yadyra, have you been busy up there?" They asked, in their heavy southern accent, which
                        one Yadyra was still getting used to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Yes, I have been. Yourself?" He replied, though they couldn't really see each other well, he
                        knew they were there. And same to them. "I see, it's been pretty quiet down here. I had a bit of
                        a flood of new souls, but that was normal, older ages come in like a flood at times when they
                        all depart at once."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Hmm, interesting, you really do need to tell me about the often happenings of your flow,
                        Ahaur." Yadyra remarked, rubbing his chin for a moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Back to work we go." Ahaur replied, though, and they both went their separate ways for now. And
                        like that, the guardian of life was gone, must've been important Ahaur knew he'd come by later,
                        since he seemed to be ever curious, since there were things about death even he didn't know, and
                        knowledge is Yadyra's favorite subject, matter not really what he was learning, as long as he
                        was learning, he was more than often interested in the material. Especially the ones he knew
                        very little about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the duties of the cycle of life and death was stable for the day, the pink man made his way
                        to Ahaur, their little garden below the pink river of life, he hadn't much the chance to visit
                        this place, he'd call it two things; tranquility, and restful. He carefully put his hand to a
                        flower to see if he could "see" more of the soul resting here, and indeed he did, a quiet
                        peaceful older women she had been, resting well here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yadyra had wondered for a while, what kind of flowers these were, and had this place been of
                        their design. He'd find out soon enough, as Ahaur made their way down to him, holding some tea,
                        and bagels.
                    </p>
                    <p>Yadyra thanked them, Ahaur gave a gentle smile.</p>
                    <p>
                        "So, I hope you like it here." They started, making a motion he was allowed further in the field
                        of white flowers, and it went on for a long time, the flowers also had a light sweet scent, he'd
                        call it like lavender with something else that was probably a long-lost smell from times before
                        him, since he didn't recognize it at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "It's pleasant. A very well-made resting place, if I say so." He gave a nod, then turned his
                        attention to what was being handed to him, taking some of the tea and the bagels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "These bagels finally have some flavor. But I'm still not over the frozen water incident,
                        though." Yadyra joked, and the tea was a pleasant flavor, but it was hard to identify the flavor
                        of this one too. He didn't mind much though, it was how Ahaur did things, and this was someone
                        who got him more than even his family, he was willing to put up a lot with them. And Ahaur
                        laughed. "I do understand water now, at least."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yadyra sighed. "At least! Now you do, don't try that again. Anyway, moving from that, tell me
                        about these flowers. I've seen such an interesting design, or smelt such a fragrance." The
                        flower itself curved in odd ways, and he had not really a way to put outside, like those circle
                        stairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ahaur nodded," I made them myself, not really based off any real design, I thought it was a nice
                        trend at the time, and now I struggle to change it."
                    </p>
                    <p>"Why is that?"</p>
                    <p>
                        "I merely don't have the right way to change the soul once it rests now. If that makes sense,
                        back then I really was creative, now I have more creative struggles on that end."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yadyra thought for a moment, in a way that makes sense, since the older ones gets in this place,
                        sometimes creativeness stops since you've hit a comfortable placement, that was something he's
                        been through time and time again. If that was a conclusion to follow, he'd just take it. It's
                        why he used such patterns that felt familiar and suited him, too. Since those patterns didn't
                        bore him, and the familiarity of the items were enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He didn't comment further, as he didn't care to think what would happen further in his infinite
                        lifespan. "I do like it, however. You've made this place as beautiful as it's been for a long
                        time, and a change isn't really necessary."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ahaur gently smiled at the compliment, "I'm glad you see it like that, come further in, there's
                        more you can't always see with the river."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yadyra gave an interested 'hoohoo?' and followed them down the flowers, that started to flower
                        into a different river. Which he didn't seem to notice at first, but there were rivers streaming
                        down around the flowerbeds. They walked into the water, that didn't really get them wet at all,
                        since it wasn't really water, more of just the illusion it was, and so going down further, he
                        could see a large white tree, and flowers around it. "And what's this?" He questioned calmly,
                        but interested in it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tree was large, white and golden. The leaves had white and gold parts as well, it spiraled
                        and twisted just like the flowers, but he could tell by the wooden look, it was a tree, at least
                        he hoped it was. Otherwise, what would they call this?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I call it the "Dreaming tree." It's a simple name, but it helps the soul in the resting, the
                        "water," we saw, actually spreads all through this whole place." Ahaur explained, with pride on
                        their face. "Come touch it, and you see some of the dreams." Yadyra now curious as what dreams
                        people might see. And interesting some had interesting dreams, as many had large dreams they
                        didn't get to experience in life, others just sought for happiness and fulfillment, but life was
                        cut too short for them. And now they dreamt of what could've been.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then he had another question, as he turned to them after pulling from the dream he was seeing.
                    </p>
                    <p>"How long does a soul stay here for?"</p>
                    <p>
                        "Probably a few hundred years as we're processing the souls into the recycle stages, and then if
                        I still find them "healthy" to move along. The long-lived ones stay here and dream forever.
                        Since, well ... otherwise, I will devour it myself."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yadyra knew what they meant, the soul gets worse the older it is, due to what it's been through.
                        Ahaur, the controller of the dead cycle, would only heal the living soul so much, for that much,
                        Yadyra knew and could respect. Keeping the cycle balanced and not corrupt laid in Ahaur's hands,
                        and they seemed to do such good job on this end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Mind if I see the river of life later as well?" Ahaur asked. Yadyra's mouth grew a smile, one
                        that was rare outside his family to see. A rather gentle one, one that isn't filled with his
                        fangs heavy mouth with a shit eating grin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Of course, it would be an honor to show you sometime, Ahaur." He replied, more than happy to,
                        but both knew again, work came first, and the two would have to meet again later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Anyway, I must be off, more universes to watch over for the day, I wish you well." Ahaur waved
                        him off as he walked away, and Yadyra had an interesting and a fun time for once, it was good to
                        be around someone who understood him more than other beings he's been around, even his own
                        family struggled to understand him at times. Glosyia who had been around for a long time, still
                        had human thoughts, Redi, his granddaughter was born broken, and her mind held no understanding
                        of emotions, and then his servant, Betelguise, was just a being with a programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>It felt nice, for once, that someone understood him.</p>
