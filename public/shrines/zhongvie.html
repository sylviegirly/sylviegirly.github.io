                            multi-paragraphs cause I'm insane over them. I haven't done any OC/Canon for about ... 8
                            years before Sylvie came into being? My last OC/Canon or self-ship content was when I was
                            around 12-14, and that was <a href="/oc/resu/index.html">for Bleach</a> of all things. Then
                            I had my <a href="/oc/hideki/index.html">original OC</a> who took over my life for 7-8 years
                            before I retired him, and haven't touched OC/Canon since then.

                            <i>Mild aside:</i> it's funny I used to self-ship when I was little with characters (my
                            first self-ships were with Roxas Kingdom Hearts and Ulquiorra from Bleach ... and I guess
                            Barry from Pokemon Platinum), but then I made an OC and found a personal lack of interest in
                            being the one to be kissing my faves. I like making OCs that fit into the world seamlessly
                            and giving them indepth relationships w/not just the F/O, but with the world itself. You
                            could argue I could do that with 'myself' but ... alas, I am a very disconnected person from
                            who I am and prefer to watch as a third party. Also ew for imagining myself

                        <p>
                            Come 2020, I got into Genshin upon release and was smitten with the world and everything ...
                            and of course, when you show to me a god who has a dragon shape, how could I not become fond
                            of him? I liked Zhongli since his release, but god knows I haven't considered a ship or
                            anything with him cause ... just wasn't at the front of my mind!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ... at least until I got inundated with ship art of him and Childe, and unfortunately saw
                            both of their characterizations butchered time and time again (fuck you mean he's a
                            narcissist/jackass for what he did). I'd be lying if I said Sylvie wasn't made out of spite
                            and annoyance for how the fandom treated him!! I wanted to give him a ship that would make
                            sense!! I do not see this man opting to date a mortal who is going to die or force
                            immortality on anyone!! He's already lost enough during the war!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ... and so uh, Sylvie came to be. I thought Dendro as a concept was cool (it wasn't out yet
                            in 2021 when I made them, Sumeru was only in bits and pieces of lore then), and I thought a
                            tree god that knew him from before the war could be a fitting half to him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Little did I expect how hard I'd fall for them both, how much Sylvie would become a comfort
                            for me, how much love I'd have for them, how much it'd fuel my artistic growth to draw
                            Sylvie ... and I met one of my closest friends through roleplaying Sylvie on tumblr (as she
                            was writing Zhongli, and she's become my writing partner and the canon Zhongli to my heart
                            and who kisses Sylvie).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm such a sucker for lovers who are friends first before all that, those that understand
                            that being a god is not all sunshine and rainbows—a shared loss of friends, of a loss of
                            identity and having no wishes of your own, of the responsibility and joy and aches. And I
                            love exploring that in them, and both of them finding peace and themselves and who they are
                            by the end of it. To enjoy life to its fullest, and embrace those that are by their side,
                            even if some they will outlive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've also met such wonderful people through the yume community and I'm honestly glad I got
                            back into it, so having them, and Sylvie, has been such a highlight of my life since then.
                            Be cringe, be free.

                    <p>
                        A bickering, old, married couple would be the simplest and easiest way to summarize their
                        dynamic—and it's what many think of them at first sight, though at the core of their
                        relationship is a foundation of a friendship that has persisted for thousands of years. Both see
                        each other as a friend and equal partner before all else, and bear a deep sense of trust and
                        respect that runs to their very essence, having seen each other at their highest and
                        brightest—and the lowest and ugliest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interactions between the two come easy and freely as water flows, resulting in either hours-long
                        conversations about the broadest and wildest of topics, or petty back and forth 'arguments' over
                        the smallest and silliest things—often instigated by Sylvie—that ends with both having a
                        chuckle.

                    <div class="quote-area sylvie">
                        <span class="name">Sylvie:</span> He is ... a lot to summarize, yet not; we've known each other
                        for so long at this point that he just feels like a part of my world. Huhu ... my partner, my
                        friend, my mate, all that cheesy stuff. A bully as well, even if many don't believe me! He acts
                        as if I'm the only childish one between us and bats his pretty eyelashes when I point out
                        something, when he's here frowning if I'm eyeballing any Rex Lapis merch or correcting him.
                        Which ... gods, if I'll be honest, I'm glad for. After seeing him weighed down for so long in
                        his role of Archon, I'm relieved he can finally relax and joke around, and I can be there by his
                        side when doing so ... even if we both have quite a few things we still need to heal from.

                        for me to properly discuss them. They are ... a friend I would be glad to have at my side until
                        the last grain of sand drops from the hourglass. Although they can be eccentric in their own
                        unique ways, it would be a folly to assume them to be silly and inattentive to the world around
                        themselves; truth be told, it is a farce more often than not. Though I know all too well that
                        they are quite—and I do mean this fondly—a boorish, childish idiot sometimes. Even so, I
                        wouldn't change it for the world, nor pass the opportunity to tease them for it.

                    <h3 id="first-meeting">First Meeting</h3>
                    <p>
                        A long, long time ago was when these two first met ... a time before the Seven were a thing,
                        before the Archon Wars, and when gods were abundant and plentiful across the land; Sylvie, going
                        as Foras back then, often travelled during the winter months (as they were known to 'hibernate'
                        by the people of Sumeru during that time). Their travels brought them to the lush lands of old
                        Liyue, where a certain old god was taking a rest with his majestic draconic tail swaying around.
                        Impulse and curiosity pushed the God of Trees in their feral form to bite into that tail and see
                        how hard the scales were, only to be met with a violent whack to their head by the God of
                        Contracts, Morax.
                    </p>

                        Although the childish action earned some bickering between the two and butting of their heads,
                        Foras continued to come around to visit Morax, finding amusement in his bluntness and cracking
                        through his stoic personality. Foras's persistence in coming around on their trips, alongside
                        their eagerness to talk, share their own stories, to spar with him, and their general carefree
                        nature eventually warmed Morax up to their company for many years to come, and to this very day.

                        became almost like a second home for the Dendro god, making many roots and ties over the years
                        they visited.

                    <h3 id="archon-war">Archon War and Death</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Archon War was not kind on either of them, with many gods at each other's throats for the
                        prized seats in the heavens above, and with people—normal humans—looking to the gods for
                        protection in a time of strife and chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Morax had the people of Liyue to protect as gods, both friends and foe alike, fell around him.
                        No time to mourn, no time to think, no time to look at who had fallen on the battleground. Only
                        one wilted Glaze Lily was lost right in his arms during this time, the one loss he was doomed to
                        see with his own eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sylvie had the people of Sumeru under their wing; although not the god of a full nation, they
                        cherished and adored the people that looked up to them. Although they did their best to protect
                        everyone, trees were falling, the grounds were shattering, and no amount of Dendro powers were
                        to keep them isolated and safe. And so, in a desperate attempt to find safety for their people,
                        they tried to get them out of Sumeru, to gods they knew even in the throes of war would still
                        extend a hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But many had their own issues, many had their hands full, their houses crumbling, to where even
                        their own people were fighting to survive. Others were already dead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their search for the safety of their people brought them out all the way to Mondstadt, that
                        during then was a frigid iceland and battle between Andrius and Decarabian; Andrius was one of
                        the gods that Sylvie was on relatively good terms with—even if the two disagreed on their views
                        of humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But they never even got a chance to reach him, finding their death in the frigid wastelands of
                        Mondstadt, and with their people left behind in Sumeru, unknowing of what happened to their god.

                    <p>
                        In reality, Sylvie had died, but their abilities are rooted in regeneration, which kicked in for
                        the very first time ever with their 'death'; their body was surrounded by enough Dendro to
                        slowly stitch and hold their form back together and to keep it from dispersing violently. Even
                        so, this process took a thousand years, leaving them to slumber comatose under what would be the
                        Windrise Tree in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their awakening brought a wave of confusion, anguish, and hurt; the war had come to an end, and
                        their existence has come to disappear in the history of Teyvat. Who was to know Foras anymore?
                        Did anyone look for them? Were their people okay? Were their people angry? Their death robbed
                        them of themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What was their purpose anymore, if not to be a god? And so, their identity was shed, and so was
                        Sylvie born. Even so, they wanted to seek out the gods that remained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was relief in finding out that Morax, now under the title of Rex Lapis, was still
                        alive—but there was a distant rift that hung awkwardly over them due to the unspoken loss
                        between the two of them, of old friends, of people they were meant to protect, and more. Sylvie
                        did their best to try to maintain their connection, especially as few gods remained, but the
                        other god kept a large distance between them, coming off tired and with the responsibility of
                        his role as Archon superseding any personal desires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was frustrating, lonely, and heart-aching, only dulled by the fact that their time was
                        occupied otherwise learning the world of the living, and what it means to be human. But they
                        wouldn't give up on their friendship. Not when they could see how lonely it was in return to be
                        an Archon.

                        ... distant, and tired, and changed. But I wanted to try. He was among the few things I still
                        had left from the past. And I know how much it takes in giving up yourself to be a god to the

                        The Cataclysm was a catalyst for Sylvie to disappear off Teyvat for the last five-hundred years
                        and into the Dark Sea, their anger towards Celestia too great to remain around the other gods.
                        Although a lonely, and harrowing experience, it helped them in expanding their knowledge and
                        even meeting some new faces they would call friends now. They still lingered on the fringes of
                        Teyvat, catching bits and pieces of news, but not having the courage to return after so many
                        years had now passed.

                        Upon promptly going through all the stages of grief over staged death—with massive relief in
                        seeing he was alive and doing a terrible job of disguising himself—Sylvie came to find that Rex
                        Lapis was now under a new identity as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor consultant, Zhongli. The name
                        of Rex Lapis was left behind, along with the responsibilities of Archon. Now with ample free
                        time on his hands and no weight to hold him back anymore, Sylvie's warmth was returned, and
                        their friendship was rekindled in full without there being any barriers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without realization (at least on Sylvie's side in the beginning), their mutual care and
                        connection flourished into underlying romantic feelings that unfurled as the two now could truly
                        live for themselves, with Zhongli accepting his own in full while quietly, patiently waiting for
                        them—because it was not hard to see that they felt the same in return.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>(His attempts to flirt with them had promptly gone well over their head, though.)</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Sylvie, meanwhile, struggled with their own out of fear of ruining their friendship that had
                        barely just been rekindled. But over time, over the months they've returned, over fleeting
                        touches, compliments that held more than what was said, being welcomed so openly back into his
                        arms and life ... it bubbled up into impulsiveness that made Sylvie take the first action in
                        kissing him—almost causing a full-blown panic at them ruining said friendship—only for Zhongli
                        to reassure them the feelings were shared in full.

                        happy I was to finally, finally see him living for himself that it all just kinda coalesced into
                        a lot of foreign feelings for him I didn't know how to handle. Gods, sometimes I wish he had
                        just kissed me first. Embarrassing that I was the last between us two to realize it was a mutual

                        feelings. I thought I was being pretty forward with my gestures and words, but I can see from
                        their point of view that it would be hard to think of it as such after seeing me be so withdrawn
                        for many years, then greeting them with complete openness and trust. Truthfully, had they not
                        taken the initiative, I would've revealed my feelings sooner or later.

                        Alongside following the traveller's journey, Sylvie's return has given both the opportunity to
                        heal and bring some doors to a close. Sylvie's death—unfortunately viewed in full by Zhongli
                        through walking in their dreams—finally allowed him to grieve and acknowledge their death in
                        full, and his heavy guilt in not thinking of them until much, much later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visiting Sumeru, after many years of avoiding it, brought closure to Sylvie for how their past
                        self and history had been ripped away from them with their death and the conclusion of the war,
                        finally finding enough comfort to call Sumeru their home once more and to be welcomed with open
                        arms by the forest that never forgot.

                    <p>
                        A funeral was held for them, by Zhongli's gentle nudging, to fully say goodbye to Foras. A
                        funeral that hurt, but was something for the both of them to bring closure to.

                        Some other major instances include an incident at the chasm which resulted in a massive injury
                        to Sylvie, half of their torso being completely obliterated in the process of destroying an
                        Abyssal demon that was threatening to leak out to the chasm's surface, leaving them bedridden
                        for a month as their body slowly purged the abyssal poison within. Zhongli carefully helped in
                        nursing them back to health, letting Sylvie see his vulnerability and fear in losing them again

                        Their relationship eventually culminated in an accidental marriage; the first birthday spent
                        together with him as <i>Zhongli</i> resulted in Sylvie

                        of it until others pointed it out. Later, for their birthday, he has

                        that have been carved to represent both of them; jade and wood melded together in the shape of a
                        deer and dragon ... though with full intentions as a proposal gift for them.

                        Even so, their relationship truthfully hasn't changed much even with being officially together
                        and married; they come off like

                        Teyvat is their oyster to explore now—as their own people and selves.

                        considering at that point we were already together, it's kinda like ... 'no shit' it comes off
                        like a proposal. Mm ... I wouldn't have it any other way; I'm happy to call him my husband, even

                        about finding a suitor for me. I don't see much need to advertise it, our companionship speaks

                                    The word for jade and forest do overlap in how it's said, so it's a bit of a dual
                                    word play.

                            That's not to speak of the many nicknames Sylvie has for Zhongli with the mere purpose to
                            annoy him (parched rock, sir consultant, dusty old man, your highness, Rex Lapis
                            (derogatory), etc.). They usually don't work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Zhongli has (unfortunately) had Sylvie's terrible humour rub off on him and has laughed at
                            the word boobies—to his own shame and hope that Sylvie never finds out, otherwise they won't
                            let him live it down.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Zhongli often has his accessories stolen by Sylvie just because they want to wear them
                            (namely his hair clasp and earring). This has culminated in him getting gifted a big green
                            bow to use as a hair clasp because they thought it'd be silly.

                            before they had gotten together, though the purpose of it was more to help with the aches
                            and emptiness from giving up his own; little does Sylvie know that they've given him a
                            life-line for them to revive from that piece were they to be killed.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The simplest explanation is that Sylvie can regenerate from any piece of themselves,
                                    that includes the one they've made from their own essence. The only cost is they'd
                                    not have the full memories from when they 'separated' it from themselves, they'd
                                    have <i>his</i> memories muddied with theirs instead

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Subsequently, he has later on for their first birthday gifted them one in return as a
                            symbolic and loving gesture, though not to the same concentration of elemental energy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They alternate between whose teapot they sleep in, as both Sylvie and Zhongli have their own
                            ... but primarily, if they are in Liyue, they stay at Zhongli's physical residence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If someone were to ask them whose the freakiest between them two, Sylvie would point to
                            Zhongli with zero hestiation and he'd bat his eyelashes and go like
                            <i>'who, little old me?'</i>

                            Sylvie's hair was designed on purpose to kinda mirror his with a giant gradient fringe +
                            gradient hair ends, but to have a gradient middle strand instead.
