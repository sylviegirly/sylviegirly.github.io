                            Of course, all my art social medias are linked here! Sketches will usually not be included
                            unless I <i>really</i> like them or feel like I wanna show them off (I usually only ever

                            artistic nudity and mildly suggestive stuff will be present.

                            Art for the most part will not be organized by when it was made in the year, though newer
                            art I will add after the creation of the page will be at the front. I will try my best to
                            have alt text for everything, but some might be a lot less detailed. Some art may look funky
                            because I <a href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/" class="external">Glaze</a> my newer
                            artworks, and commission art will have a more prominent watermark.

                        A decent amount of Elsword fanart, I think this is when I got deeper into playing it and settled
                        into a new main class (<a href="https://elwiki.net/w/Demonio">Demonio</a>) that released this
                        year. My first full year of college as well and I kinda went nuts with doing art this year (I
                        think out of all my years this has the most finalized art).

                        The year <a href="oc/hideki.html">Hideki</a> fully came into being, so a lot of art from here on
                        out for like 7-ish years are centric more around him. Drawings definitely erred on a lot more
                        messy. A lot of my artwork is missing in its original formats, so they're pulled off my old
                        tumblrs.

                    <p>
                        Hodgepodge of whatever other files I've got saved on my laptop, some of these range from 2013,
                        to 2009, to even physical art from my young days. The era of <a href="oc/resu">Resu</a>. It's a
                        combination of my beginning tablet days (Wacom Bamboo Fun) and my mouse + MS paint + devART
                        bases + when I used to draw only traditionally. Roughly from 'newest' to oldest.
