            &#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;ve been putting off doing a now update since I felt like I didn&#x27;t have much to yap
            about, but I&#x27;ll probably be a little freaky/excited in the games section sooooo apt time to do
            it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;h2&#x3E;What&#x27;s Been Going On?&#x3C;/h2&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Got
            to hang out with one of my classmates and we&#x27;re gonna go to a pancake place tomorrow which is
            cool!!!&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;My college wants to do a news segment on our project we did in December
            which is also pretty dang awesome&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Getting payment for contracts sucks ass
            (pulling teeth)&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Made my first HTML/CSS templates to share, and I&#x27;ve been
            trying to put my carrds for sale on VGen but it&#x27;s a convoluted ass system (manually sharing access to
            people)&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E; &#x3C;h2&#x3E;Games&#x3C;/h2&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E;

            and 6 came out today and &#x3C;u&#x3E;I NEED MOR I NEED MORE I NEEDDHHRHRHGHG&#x3C;/u&#x3E; IT&#x27;S SO
            GOOD IM ON MY HANDS AND KNEES TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS GOTY FOR ME 10/10 HUMOUR IS FUNNY AS FUCK LOVE
            EVERYONE!!!! (I don&#x27;t like all the romantic implications of stuff cause I ain&#x27;t here to date I got

            got some ugly tears out of me at the end. To the wildass shippers, no this is a platonic story about love
            (half joking but I&#x27;m also half dreading the male trailblazer self-insert het freaks rising out of the
            woodworks over Cyrene)&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E; &#x3C;h2&#x3E;Watching / Reading&#x3C;/h2&#x3E;

            comes to layouts and not overthinking it too much&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;On a smaller note, I updated my

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Sorely overdue but I added stuff to the #me memes section of my about page, with memes
            I&#x27;ll probably yoink off my personal tumblr tag. I also added a few new quiz results, and getting an
            angel from evangelion as my assigned gender is a sickass result&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            Kid&#x27;s&#x3C;/a&#x3E; cool calendar to the front page (only visible on desktop) and added a little

            for longer posts, since I&#x27;ll probably stop adding them to my blog page on here ... which I guess now is
            more of a microblog!! Bearblog just feels nicer to get full thoughts out on there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

        <content type="html">
            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Not a very exciting now page update, mostly just small life stuff, and it&#x27;s been a bit of
            a blur. As a more minor thing, I&#x27;ve been doing article reading and wrote a &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://zhongvie.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20/&#x22;&#x3E;small blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on the concept
            of bookmarks. I also fixed my &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://zhongvie.neocities.org/articles/food.html&#x22;&#x3E;food log&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page to be a
            bit cleaner with griddery, and updated some recent foods&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;hr /&#x3E;
            &#x3C;h3&#x3E;What&#x27;s Been Going On?&#x3C;/h3&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Finally got my contract
            work set up, now I&#x27;m gritting my teeth for my bank to finally open my business account so I can get to
            work!!!! &#x1F621;&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Kinda been a blur ... mostly focused on editing my
            friend&#x27;s book and doing the cover work for it&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Learned about the concept of
            a &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://winreyplace.neocities.org/library/what-is-munbonding-03-04-2025&#x22;&#x3E;munbond&#x3C;/a&#x3E;,
            and although I am still a bit hesitant to use it, it is what describes what I have with Sylvie perfectly
            (they are like a brain companion to me that&#x27;s very alive on their own/reactive without my
            input)&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I made a &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://www.pillowfort.social/sylviegirly&#x22;&#x3E;personal pillowfort&#x3C;/a&#x3E; account as
            well, and I&#x27;m just trying to yap there more ... but I gotta learn to balance out with interacting on my
            art account too&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I gotta get back to journaling ... last week was a bad blur, so
            I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve written anything down&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E;
            &#x3C;h3&#x3E;Games&#x3C;/h3&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Sighs Cookie Run Kingdom got me in its
            clutches again ... to be fair, finding out you can &#x27;bank&#x27; and hide your production buildings has
            been a literal godsend and got me back into it &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Ended up getting all the current
            Beast cookies too LOL&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I mostly came back for Millennial Tree in December
            because Millennial Tree is the literal &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://zhongvie.neocities.org/shrines/zhongvie.html&#x22;&#x3E;Zhongvie&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

            Reading&#x3C;/h3&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Finished Castlevania: Nocturne and Apothecary Diaries
            rewatch, which has been awesome&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Hoping to start Digital Circus
            soon&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Got back into reading The Hollow Places by T. Kingfisher and I&#x27;m
            accumulating more books I wanna read &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I found a 2002 edition of the first LOTR
            book from my mini library, and I wanna read it before I return it back&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Maybe
            for next year I can up my &#x3C;em&#x3E;5 books a year&#x3C;/em&#x3E; to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;8 books a
            year&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as a little goal&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E; &#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;I ended up caving to make a fun page to just document all the stuff I&#x27;ve cooked and eaten
            over a period of time; I do not take selfies, I just take food photos LOL. It&#x27;ll be one of those
            long-term projects since I need to dig through my phone and just be wary that the id for each

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Big ugly code riddled page in trying to break down how I set up my website layout ... at least
            it was an excuse to actually optimize some stuff in the HTML since there were classes in two separate places
            ... and some of my layout calculations were wrong. I&#x27;ll probably expand on it in the future, depending
            on what questions might come up or if people show interest in the way I did some stuff.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            skull, but enough to work out a layout ... even so, it still was a lot of work to set up around
            40&#x26;ndash;50 images and to WEBP everything. I&#x27;ll&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;em&#x3E;really&#x3C;/em&#x3E; need

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Another rambly think piece; I guess my blogs end up being more of a dissection of my own self
            more than anything, or a study piece of something ... but I didn&#x27;t always used to have such a divide of

            touched upon this a bit, but I thought I&#x27;d get a little more ... in-depth I guess? I&#x27;m always a
            little nervous talking about it because I ID as cis (minor aside for &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cassgender&#x22;&#x3E;cassgender&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and maybe aligning

            the &#x27;barest association with being a girl&#x27; description which would be funny cause then 2014 me was
            right to identify with the concept) and some part of me always worries if I&#x27;m overstepping on toes in
            discussing gender, or how I discuss it, or exploring it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Dang, been on a bit of a roll with these; after figuring out a nicer way to WEBP convert, the
            only real issue is just making thumbnails of everything and writing up ALT text for each art piece ... to be
            fair, 2017 only has 24 art pieces compared to 2016 which had 61. Decent amount of commission for this
            year&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            now full of my artwork, and 2016 is being worked on next (which wish me luck, it&#x27;s 60 drawings I need

            though by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://nomnomnami.com/&#x22;&#x3E;NomNomNami&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it makes it feel
            more freeing to write small posts like I would on my tumblr, and some of the &#x27;fluff&#x27; posts are
            actually pulled from there.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;ll be adding more &#x27;filler&#x27; posts
            over time, since it looks a little weird to me to just have continual chunks of long form posts. Maybe
            I&#x27;ll upload some of my sketches here as well, and photos I take of my lunches since I&#x27;ve been
            documenting my bentos I take to school for the last few months.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;Added a new video

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;A few changes inbound: I added a full font toggle with different font options, and opted to

            page layout.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;On a more character end, I finally brought over Sylvie&#x27;s game
            kit, cause I realize I never did actually include it in their character page even though it&#x27;s been
            fully designed. By extension, I did now finally come up with recommended weapons, artifacts, and teams for
            them which I did&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;em&#x3E;not&#x3C;/em&#x3E; have before.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Updated now page again! ... I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s been a bit over two weeks since my
            last update; I wanna try to keep them to a bi-weekly basis for my own tracking as well to look back on for
            funsies&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;RSS feed is special and gets a little update I&#x27;m not placing on my front page ... but
            it&#x27;s just me giving a heads up that I added a bunch more games to my media log, mostly centric around
            &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://backloggd.com/u/Asuraid/list/nostalgia--games-i-grew-up-on/&#x22;&#x3E;my
            nostalgia list&#x3C;/a&#x3E; off backloggd; not all of them have a review yet (since my brain would burn out
            writing that many) but I got them included for when I&#x27;m ready to write&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;Sorry
            for the massive rant under Elsword (I&#x27;m not)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            template&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and I wanted to make a little page for just thought dumps + random links I feel
            won&#x27;t fit into my bookmarks page ... I probably won&#x27;t make any update posts when I add stuff to
            it, since that&#x27;s literally just a brain dump zone, but it&#x27;s a nice little slice of life area where
            everything is gathered more nicely.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;I am terrible at knowing what to make lists
            of though, even though I love the concept a lot :P&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;New blog post, though I&#x27;d call it more of an unorganized thought dump. Mostly surrounding
            me talking about how I view my own identity, and more as something to empty my brain out of my thoughts!
            It&#x27;s definitely a more personal blab.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Brought in one of my oldest OCs which is my Bleach OC! Her profile is rough cause god knows it

            3&#x26;ndash;4 years before she was retired. Had it not been for her, I&#x27;d have never met such wonderful
