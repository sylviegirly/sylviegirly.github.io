        <content type="html">
            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Not a very exciting now page update, mostly just small life stuff, and it&#x27;s been a bit of
            a blur. As a more minor thing, I&#x27;ve been doing article reading and wrote a &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://zhongvie.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20/&#x22;&#x3E;small blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on the concept
            of bookmarks. I also fixed my &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://zhongvie.neocities.org/articles/food.html&#x22;&#x3E;food log&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page to be a
            bit cleaner with griddery, and updated some recent foods&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;hr /&#x3E;
            &#x3C;h2&#x3E;What&#x27;s Been Going On?&#x3C;/h2&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Finally got my contract
            work set up, now I&#x27;m gritting my teeth for my bank to finally open my business account so I can get to
            work!!!! &#x1F621;&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Kinda been a blur ... mostly focused on editing my
            friend&#x27;s book and doing the cover work for it&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Learned about the concept of
            a &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://winreyplace.neocities.org/library/what-is-munbonding-03-04-2025&#x22;&#x3E;munbond&#x3C;/a&#x3E;,
            and although I am still a bit hesitant to use it, it is what describes what I have with Sylvie perfectly
            (they are like a brain companion to me that&#x27;s very alive on their own/reactive without my
            input)&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I made a &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://www.pillowfort.social/sylviegirly&#x22;&#x3E;personal pillowfort&#x3C;/a&#x3E; account as
            well, and I&#x27;m just trying to yap there more ... but I gotta learn to balance out with interacting on my
            art account too&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I gotta get back to journaling ... last week was a bad blur, so
            I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve written anything down&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E;
            &#x3C;h2&#x3E;Games&#x3C;/h2&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Sighs Cookie Run Kingdom got me in its
            clutches again ... to be fair, finding out you can &#x27;bank&#x27; and hide your production buildings has
            been a literal godsend and got me back into it &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Ended up getting all the current
            Beast cookies too LOL&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I mostly came back for Millennial Tree in December
            because Millennial Tree is the literal &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://zhongvie.neocities.org/shrines/zhongvie.html&#x22;&#x3E;Zhongvie&#x3C;/a&#x3E;
            lovechild&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E; &#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E; &#x3C;h2&#x3E;Watching /
            Reading&#x3C;/h2&#x3E; &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Finished Castlevania: Nocturne and Apothecary Diaries
            rewatch, which has been awesome&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Hoping to start Digital Circus
            soon&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Got back into reading The Hollow Places by T. Kingfisher and I&#x27;m
            accumulating more books I wanna read &#x3C;ul&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;I found a 2002 edition of the first LOTR
            book from my mini library, and I wanna read it before I return it back&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;li&#x3E;Maybe
            for next year I can up my &#x3C;em&#x3E;5 books a year&#x3C;/em&#x3E; to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;8 books a
            year&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as a little goal&#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E; &#x3C;/li&#x3E; &#x3C;/ul&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;I ended up caving to make a fun page to just document all the stuff I&#x27;ve cooked and eaten
            over a period of time; I do not take selfies, I just take food photos LOL. It&#x27;ll be one of those
            long-term projects since I need to dig through my phone and just be wary that the id for each
            &#x27;item&#x27; in the masonry grid is different...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Big ugly code riddled page in trying to break down how I set up my website layout ... at least
            it was an excuse to actually optimize some stuff in the HTML since there were classes in two separate places
            ... and some of my layout calculations were wrong. I&#x27;ll probably expand on it in the future, depending
            on what questions might come up or if people show interest in the way I did some stuff.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;In an attempt to try to offload some of my stuff from Toyhouse, I&#x27;ve made my first art

            skull, but enough to work out a layout ... even so, it still was a lot of work to set up around
            40&#x26;ndash;50 images and to WEBP everything. I&#x27;ll&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;em&#x3E;really&#x3C;/em&#x3E; need

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Another rambly think piece; I guess my blogs end up being more of a dissection of my own self
            more than anything, or a study piece of something ... but I didn&#x27;t always used to have such a divide of
            the personal self, and the &#x27;art&#x27; self.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#60;p&#62;Cleaned up my index to reorganize since it's a way to combat the horrible itchy 'aughh I wanna

            around. New poll as well!&#60;/p&#62;

            touched upon this a bit, but I thought I&#x27;d get a little more ... in-depth I guess? I&#x27;m always a
            little nervous talking about it because I ID as cis (minor aside for &#x3C;a
            href=&#x22;https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cassgender&#x22;&#x3E;cassgender&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and maybe aligning

            href=&#x22;https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Demigender#Subgenders&#x22;&#x3E;demigirl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; if you use
            the &#x27;barest association with being a girl&#x27; description which would be funny cause then 2014 me was
            right to identify with the concept) and some part of me always worries if I&#x27;m overstepping on toes in
            discussing gender, or how I discuss it, or exploring it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            my new Sims 3 legacy challenge ... maybe if I ever do finish it, I&#x27;ll make a page here about it

            now full of my artwork, and 2016 is being worked on next (which wish me luck, it&#x27;s 60 drawings I need

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Rehauled the blog page and reinstated the previous blog entries I had there, though now
            they&#x27;re just all on one page, which ... undoes all my previous work. Oh well! I really like this layout
            though by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://nomnomnami.com/&#x22;&#x3E;NomNomNami&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it makes it feel
            more freeing to write small posts like I would on my tumblr, and some of the &#x27;fluff&#x27; posts are
            actually pulled from there.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;ll be adding more &#x27;filler&#x27; posts
            over time, since it looks a little weird to me to just have continual chunks of long form posts. Maybe
            I&#x27;ll upload some of my sketches here as well, and photos I take of my lunches since I&#x27;ve been
            documenting my bentos I take to school for the last few months.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;Added a new video

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Mass Effect and Sims are more of a general yapping rather than having sections for each

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;A few changes inbound: I added a full font toggle with different font options, and opted to
            remove my dark/light mode toggle for the fully built in prefers-system CSS code. Also adjusted the index
            page layout.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;On a more character end, I finally brought over Sylvie&#x27;s game
            kit, cause I realize I never did actually include it in their character page even though it&#x27;s been
            fully designed. By extension, I did now finally come up with recommended weapons, artifacts, and teams for
            them which I did&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;em&#x3E;not&#x3C;/em&#x3E; have before.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;I caved and made a media log to document some of my tracked media in a single place; although
            it won&#x27;t be everything I list in my tracking specific sites, I&#x27;d like to show off the stuff
            I&#x27;ve consumed and my thoughts on them!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

        <title>New Blog ... Diary-esque Post</title>

        <content type="html">
            &#x3C;p&#x3E;New blog post, though I&#x27;d call it more of an unorganized thought dump. Mostly surrounding
            me talking about how I view my own identity, and more as something to empty my brain out of my thoughts!
            It&#x27;s definitely a more personal blab.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

            &#x3C;p&#x3E;Brought in one of my oldest OCs which is my Bleach OC! Her profile is rough cause god knows it
            was written well over ten years ago, but she&#x27;s one of my more developed OCs I had immensely active for
            3&#x26;ndash;4 years before she was retired. Had it not been for her, I&#x27;d have never met such wonderful
            people in the OC/Canon community back then.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img
