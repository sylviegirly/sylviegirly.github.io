    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        <p>
                            All images are from newest to oldest, so you can see my forever world budding from uh ...
                            when I picked the game up again! My world was originally made in December 2023, but I only
                            began playing more earnestly in March 2025.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Minecraft has always been a little scary for me as a game concept, if only due to the fact
                            that sandbox games have too many options and I freeze up! But I think I've found myself a
                            little forever home and world I've been enjoying exploring, and want to document it more
                            thoroughly rather than just have snippets I've posted on my tumblr, or in discord chats. I
                            am
                            <u>very</u> late to the minecraft party, but I'm excited to share it here.
                        </p>
                        <p>My general game 'manifesto' is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I will keep my builds small, big builds scary to me and I have no patience</li>
                            <li>I want to connect all my villages / cool structures to my base with decorated paths</li>
                            <li>If I make farms, they will be minimal / aesthetic focused</li>
                            <li>
                                Creative mode is ok for builds!! I do not wanna chop 100 trees or burn out on a
                                project!!
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If creative mode is used, I will not add blocks/creatures I do not have access
                                        to/have not found (ex. I will not use acacia wood since I've not found it yet)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <b>12/13/25:</b> Mostly just building farms ... built a smelter with built in lava drip now
                            that I came across dripstone caves, a clay farm, a simple water well (even though I realize
                            the clay farm I built already had a renewable water source), and I'll make a sugar cane farm
                            and reuse the same layout for a bamboo farm when ... err, I find bamboo. I doubt I will for
                            a while, the biomes I've had around have not lent themselves to being jungle. Kinda fucking
                            sucks!! I'd have liked access to pandas which can drop slime from one of my mods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Otherwise I've been trying to focus on leveling my villager jobs, and pondering on how to
                            protect the village without just making ugly tall walls cause I've definitely lost one of my
                            librarians and farmers somehow. I know 'sweet berries hidden under a carpet' deter mobs but
                            the issue is that with a plains village, the ground isn't even enough to really do that all
                            around and I have paths I can't break.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sighs, damn I'm really just gonna have to make a shitload of fences aren't I LMAO.</p>
                        <p>
                            On a later note, I finally gathered enough ghast tears to make my own dried ghast and grew
                            it into a big boy who I named Casper LOL. Made a lil place, still getting used to how to get
                            back on when you dismount ...

                                    Enderman farming scary ... I was hoping the ender clams from my progression mod
                                    would've been more plentiful to farm ender pearls like that, but nope. Had to go
                                    basic 'hide in a 2 block high shelter and kill endermen' route. Did end up locating
                                    the stronghold though, and in the process found a giant collection of pale gardens
                                    not too far off, an altar for my peaceful progression mod, and another village ...
                                    that makes it 4 villages in my very close(ish) proximity, alongside a mushroom
                                    forest and more consistent dark oak forests.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I'm definitely nowhere near ready for the ender dragon, but I managed to waypoint
                                    the area + dug myself out some water bubble columns to go up and down
                                </p>

                                    ... saved a zombified villager thinking it was from my own nearby village only for
                                    it to turn into a nitwit. Well, I guess they can just live in the village, there
                                    should be enough beds to house them LOL. I also made a flower farm based off this
                                    <a href="https://youtu.be/iiJGWlD2kNc">mini farm video</a>, and I really wanna do
                                    the AFK stone farm and maybe the bamboo. The piglin bartering farm is pretty cool as
                                    well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ... okay I did end up doing the afk stone farm as well and made a little bat
                                    sanctuary. Explored one of the caverns I had nearby and found like ... maybe 9
                                    diamonds? Surprisingly not at a deep Y level. Rescued a villager zombie thinking it
                                    was one of my own only to see it was a nitwit LMAO.

                                    Mostly been focusing on leveling up my villagers and blaze farming (obnoxiously died
                                    a lot during it) ... I wanna knock out the ender dragon so I can start exploring the
                                    end islands ... I know people say Elytra makes exploration moot but man considering
                                    how much of my map is just basic bitch biomes, I've had no luck with finding more
                                    interesting stuff around me.
                                </p>

                                    I also ended up getting a mod to have a % chance to spawn Sniffers in villages LOL
                                    ... I ... I wanted one rlly badly (and plus the peaceful progression mod I have
                                    relies on sniffers for finding some items). I have 3 villages in my zone, and found
                                    one in my main one, and another in the nearby one. I've only gotten one torchflower
                                    seed for breeding, so still need to wait. I did make them a
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uis1DT1eqY">little sanctuary</a> though,
                                    though since I have no access to the wood and stone used here, I just used my normal
                                    building materials.
                                </p>

                                    I wanna try a bat sanctuary at some point too, cause again, bats have a use now for
                                    my peaceful progression mod (and can be bred), and I saw this one I
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlaR6Z2YmY8">wanna do</a>!!

                                    I ... found a

                                    I really like. It's funny, I'm still probably going to play on Easy/Normal (aside
                                    from days I'm very tired of mobs), and try to fight the Ender Dragon myself, but I
                                    like the concept of being able to get things in alternative ways (and in fun ways
                                    too). I would really like to try to find a Sniffer though, but I don't think I have
                                    any biomes in easy access for them 🥲

                                    I might at some point just have to get on a boat and explore outside of my area to
                                    find new biomes.

                                    alongside a village ... which had two alchemist standing things LOL. Mine now. They
                                    have a pretty tree as their town center. Weirdly half merged with a snow biome too
                                    ... and there's an igloo half merged with a house. And a floating log ... and a big,
                                    <i>gorgeous</i> lush cavern with no roof ... this is super far away from home
                                    though, and I already have a lush cavern tied to my old house I can go into.

                                    Nothing else major of note, I made a little mini auto composter to dump off all my
                                    dupe seeds for the time being, and got my first diamond crate while fishing. Got a
                                    few emeralds and a diamond horse armor (which I already had LOL).

                                    At this rate I might just have to rely on the wandering trader for dripstone ... I
                                    do have a giant ocean besides me, so maybe I'll have luck with suspicious sand or
                                    gravel. I dunno what ocean warmth it is.

                                    Finally began digging out a mine that's in relative easy distance from my home to
                                    not get mob swamped ... sadly my Nether portal is still kind of a walk from my home,
                                    and I sorely need to spawn-proof it with more lights. Found a very nice and large
                                    open cave with waterfalls, so traversal is a little easier, but I don't have access
                                    to diamond mine levels anymore unless I go back to my old house that had a strip
                                    mine set up.

                                    (I went back and got a lotta nothing. 4 diamonds is basically peepee poopoo for me.)

                                    And ok I lied when I said I wouldn't get gameplay mods, I did get a fishing one
                                    which was
                                    <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/gone-fishing">Gone Fishing!</a> cause I sorely
                                    wish fishing was more exciting. I like sitting and just manually fishing; it was
                                    always the first skill I maxed in Stardew Valley just by happenstance LMAO.

                                    There was one I was eyeballing that was a

                                    but I really don't want to introduce new mobs and monuments and all that stuff so
                                    ... something more light, but still with decent changes, works.

                                    Finished making a little copper golem system for organizing, but it's on a very
                                    small scale. I'm sure I'll also outgrow it in due time, but it's doing what it needs
                                    to for now in dropping off crap I don't need at the moment.

                                    I really should start pondering making mob/XP grinders ... problem is so many are so
                                    ugly and there aren't many aesthetic ones that don't make me wanna explode into
                                    viscera to build or need me to make a scaffold up into the asscrack of the world to
                                    wait out spawns.
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttObYxdgOB4">This one</a> is tempting but
                                    it needs armadillos which ... I haven't found. I do use creative mode in some
                                    instances but I do not want to put in items of stuff I haven't genuinely found yet
                                    in the world.

                                    I did make a farm area to host a coop of chickens and a trio of pigs, sheep, and
                                    cows. I'd still wanna make some farms that insta spit out meat + leather + raw
                                    chicken but that's later. Somehow the chickens escaped ... do they need 2 block high
                                    fences...? I could lower the ground though but I was lazy.

                                    I also caved to finally install some mods, though it's mostly the Fabulously
                                    Optimized mod pack, a pretty shader pack, and better leaves. I don't wanna add any
                                    gameplay changing mods, I just like seeing pretty leaves and colours, though I'm
                                    trying very hard to not get distracted by all the shiny visual mods.

                                    Err ... well it's been a good long while since I last played ... honestly I didn't
                                    take any screenshots, but I'm making a new base and want to finish it first; it's
                                    not far from my old one at all, and a nether portal connects the two, but I really
                                    wanted to make a new house close to the village I revamped. It's a plains biome, and
                                    being surrounded by horses and animals makes me happy.

                                    I found <a href="https://youtu.be/XIBLsoWyJ7c">this build</a> I really like and I'll
                                    be doing that one ... unfortunately in creative mode because I know if I'm going to
                                    do it by hand, I'm going to burn out. Working 2 hours in creative mode to only
                                    finish the exterior already did not make my skull happy. (I did finish the interior
                                    during the daytime.)

                                    I guess in this case it's a case of <i>reorganizing</i>; my first house is full of
                                    messy chests, haphazard rooms, and wasn't build for where I'm at now where I want to
                                    gut my entire chest system and begin anew with something more granular. I want a
                                    chest system that's more organized, dedicated to just certain piles, or woods, or
                                    stone types (to put it less eloquently, I want a space to have a
                                    <u>buttfuck</u> amount of chests).

                                <p>
                                    ... that and the pile of chickens living in the hybrid coop of the house were kinda
                                    driving me up a wall. Lesson learned. Animals are nice to have around, unless it's
                                    30 chickens all actively clucking in your ears.

                                    Even with the easy nether portal access, I'd still like to build a full path between
                                    my old house and the village/this new one.

                                    (... ok, the chests in this build are also very scattered around, but they're at
                                    least themed by rooms. I may still make a basement as a Mega Chest area, but
                                    otherwise try to keep things inside?

                                    trying to sort by 'themes' which I might try; my previous one used item frames which
                                    although looks nice, confused me coming back months later and being like 'what the

                                    First time playing in about ... a solid 3 weeks, and mostly it was just trying to
                                    feel out how I wanna decorate my existing villages ... I don't wanna completely
                                    overhaul the buildings or I'll burn out, but I really liked
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewwkmxrtrRo">this video</a> and how it was
                                    broken down, so I'll probably just keep it simple and keep the buildings as they
                                    are!! ... the landscape of this village is <i>ass</i> though LMFAO so I need a lot
                                    of terraforming to do ...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I did honestly end up finishing a lot of the terraforming + began moving some houses
                                    into new layouts ... mostly just swapping out oak for spruce and throwing in fences
                                    + trap doors for decorations, though I also extended out the leatherworking building
                                    to put in a bed. Idk how I lost well over half of my village while I was decorating
                                    (and somehow an iron golem died from defending stuff) but I refilled the village
                                    LOL.

                                    'continued work on sprucing up the village'.

                        <p>
                            I'm trying to keep things as vanilla as possible, but I've grabbed a few other mods to help
                            just enhance gameplay for various reasons (aka not frustrating me enough to quit). The
                            entire mod list will be below, but for baseline I use
                            <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a> to boot up my game/manage mods, and
                            used the <a href="https://download.fo/">Fabulously Optimized</a> modpack to start (so a lot
                            of them will be from that).
