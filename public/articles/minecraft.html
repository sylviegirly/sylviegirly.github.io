    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        <p>
                            All images are from newest to oldest, so you can see my forever world budding from uh ...
                            when I picked the game up again! My world was originally made in December 2023, but I only
                            began playing more earnestly in March 2025.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Minecraft has always been a little scary for me as a game concept, if only due to the fact
                            that sandbox games have too many options and I freeze up! But I think I've found myself a
                            little forever home and world I've been enjoying exploring, and want to document it more
                            thoroughly rather than just have snippets I've posted on my tumblr, or in discord chats. I
                            am
                            <u>very</u> late to the minecraft party, but I'm excited to share it here.
                        </p>
                        <p>My general game 'manifesto' is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I will keep my builds small, big builds scary to me and I have no patience</li>
                            <li>I want to connect all my villages / cool structures to my base with decorated paths</li>
                            <li>If I make farms, they will be minimal / aesthetic focused</li>
                            <li>
                                Creative mode is ok for builds!! I do not wanna chop 100 trees or burn out on a
                                project!!
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If creative mode is used, I will not add blocks/creatures I do not have access
                                        to/have not found (ex. I will not use acacia wood since I've not found it yet)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <h2>Game Diary</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>11/27/25:</b> Finally began digging out a mine that's in relative easy distance from my
                            home to not get mob swamped ... sadly my Nether portal is still kind of a walk from my home,
                            and I sorely need to spawn-proof it with more lights. Found a very nice and large open cave
                            with waterfalls, so traversal is a little easier, but I don't have access to diamond mine
                            levels anymore unless I go back to my old house that had a strip mine set up.
                        </p>
                        <p>(I went back and got a lotta nothing. 4 diamonds is basically peepee poopoo for me.)</p>
                        <p>
                            And ok I lied when I said I wouldn't get gameplay mods, I did get a fishing one which was
                            <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/gone-fishing">Gone Fishing!</a> cause I sorely wish
                            fishing was more exciting. I like sitting and just manually fishing; it was always the first
                            skill I maxed in Stardew Valley just by happenstance LMAO.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was one I was eyeballing that was a huge fishing overhaul but I really don't want to
                            introduce new mobs and monuments and all that stuff so ... something more light, but still
                            with decent changes, works.

                                    Finished making a little copper golem system for organizing, but it's on a very
                                    small scale. I'm sure I'll also outgrow it in due time, but it's doing what it needs
                                    to for now in dropping off crap I don't need at the moment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I really should start pondering making mob/XP grinders ... problem is so many are so
                                    ugly and there aren't many aesthetic ones that don't make me wanna explode into
                                    viscera to build or need me to make a scaffold up into the asscrack of the world to
                                    wait out spawns.
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttObYxdgOB4">This one</a> is tempting but
                                    it needs armadillos which ... I haven't found. I do use creative mode in some
                                    instances but I do not want to put in items of stuff I haven't genuinely found yet
                                    in the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I did make a farm area to host a coop of chickens and a trio of pigs, sheep, and
                                    cows. I'd still wanna make some farms that insta spit out meat + leather + raw
                                    chicken but that's later. Somehow the chickens escaped ... do they need 2 block high
                                    fences...? I could lower the ground though but I was lazy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I also caved to finally install some mods, though it's mostly the Fabulously
                                    Optimized mod pack, a pretty shader pack, and better leaves. I don't wanna add any
                                    gameplay changing mods, I just like seeing pretty leaves and colours, though I'm
                                    trying very hard to not get distracted by all the shiny visual mods.

                                    Err ... well it's been a good long while since I last played ... honestly I didn't
                                    take any screenshots, but I'm making a new base and want to finish it first; it's
                                    not far from my old one at all, and a nether portal connects the two, but I really
                                    wanted to make a new house close to the village I revamped. It's a plains biome, and
                                    being surrounded by horses and animals makes me happy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I found <a href="https://youtu.be/XIBLsoWyJ7c">this build</a> I really like and I'll
                                    be doing that one ... unfortunately in creative mode because I know if I'm going to
                                    do it by hand, I'm going to burn out. Working 2 hours in creative mode to only
                                    finish the exterior already did not make my skull happy. (I did finish the interior
                                    during the daytime.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I guess in this case it's a case of <i>reorganizing</i>; my first house is full of
                                    messy chests, haphazard rooms, and wasn't build for where I'm at now where I want to
                                    gut my entire chest system and begin anew with something more granular. I want a
                                    chest system that's more organized, dedicated to just certain piles, or woods, or
                                    stone types (to put it less eloquently, I want a space to have a
                                    <u>buttfuck</u> amount of chests).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ... that and the pile of chickens living in the hybrid coop of the house were kinda
                                    driving me up a wall. Lesson learned. Animals are nice to have around, unless it's
                                    30 chickens all actively clucking in your ears.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even with the easy nether portal access, I'd still like to build a full path between
                                    my old house and the village/this new one.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    (... ok, the chests in this build are also very scattered around, but they're at
                                    least themed by rooms. I may still make a basement as a Mega Chest area, but
                                    otherwise try to keep things inside?
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1sGOUjfSGo">This video</a> talked about
                                    trying to sort by 'themes' which I might try; my previous one used item frames which
                                    although looks nice, confused me coming back months later and being like 'what the
                                    fuck is this?')

                                    First time playing in about ... a solid 3 weeks, and mostly it was just trying to
                                    feel out how I wanna decorate my existing villages ... I don't wanna completely
                                    overhaul the buildings or I'll burn out, but I really liked
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewwkmxrtrRo">this video</a> and how it was
                                    broken down, so I'll probably just keep it simple and keep the buildings as they
                                    are!! ... the landscape of this village is <i>ass</i> though LMFAO so I need a lot
                                    of terraforming to do ...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I did honestly end up finishing a lot of the terraforming + began moving some houses
                                    into new layouts ... mostly just swapping out oak for spruce and throwing in fences
                                    + trap doors for decorations, though I also extended out the leatherworking building
                                    to put in a bed. Idk how I lost well over half of my village while I was decorating
                                    (and somehow an iron golem died from defending stuff) but I refilled the village
                                    LOL.

                                    This continues into the 26th as well, so no need to add a separate day for
                                    'continued work on sprucing up the village'.

                            I would also love to share some of my favourite build tutorials I've found on YouTube
                            <i>(some of which I've used)</i> since I find comfort in following along with tutorials
                            rather than freezing in not knowing what I wanna make. Anything starred (⭐) I've used in my
                            world or plan to.
