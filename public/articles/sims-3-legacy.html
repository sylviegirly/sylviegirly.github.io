                            changing how you get jobs), got so depressed over it, picked up being an acrobat, and was
                            basically so miserable that she kept crying while trying to mime for money. The game then
                            crashed when I hovered over the toilet to make her clean it, which she couldn't do due to
                            being too sad.

                                Although living was very meager, with a single toy for her and two books to be read to,
                                she grew up perfectly potty-trained and able to talk and walk, with A grades in both
                                schools, and with a love of the outdoors, fishing, cooking, and being easily impressed
