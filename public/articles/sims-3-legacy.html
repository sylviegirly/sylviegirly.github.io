                                    on my tumblr, people chose for me to do 3! SO ... here I am for 10 generations of

                            In some nightmare scenario, she ended up failing her job interview (I have a mod for
                            changing how you get jobs), got so depressed over it, picked up being an acrobat, and was
                            basically so miserable that she kept crying while trying to mime for money. The game then
                            crashed when I hovered over the toilet to make her clean it, which she couldn't do due to
                            being too sad.

                                into a full adult the next day, allowing her to properly continue on the legacy.

                                    Her boyfriend/best friend easily took to her proposal to both go steady and then to
                                    marry, but I'm waiting for the spring/summer seasons for them to have a nice summer
                                    wedding

                                            Unfortunately this proposal just happened as his mum died ... and when his
                                            birthday came around to have him grow into an adult, another family member
                                            died so he was in 4 days of mourning. Poor guy

                                    make proper portraits; I know I can take pictures at 5 to turn into paintings, but
