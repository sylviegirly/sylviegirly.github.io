    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                    Hrrrr, well I guess it might be best to start the blogging page with err, <i>a blog</i>. It might be
                    a good way to also test out placing in images into actual article pages and see how they function in
                    the first place.
                </p>
                <a href="https://arunyi.art"
                    ><img
                        class="image"
                        src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2213cb8d339100c53d6f7f2de59abd01/e6482d172fd5f133-00/s500x750/dd66bfd84c0990e0f465aac25c504372b4d03824.gif"

                </a>
                <p>
                    <b>And it works!!</b> Neat knowing block images can be centered with auto left/right margins.
                    Anyway, onto the actual blog post ... it&#39;s kinda hard cause when I do sit to think about what I
                    wanna write, I blank out; audio journalling has helped a lot on days I need to thought dump (thanks
                    <a href="https://www.untoldapp.com/">Untold</a> for that, very sad it&#39;s iOS only) but it&#39;s
                    rare that I <i>do</i> need to do it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So blog posts here will probably be very sporadic, but I will try to document things to the best of
                    my ability, might it be something I&#39;m working on or learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Right now, I&#39;m definitely in the trenches with the last 2 weeks of school, considering
                    assignments are heavily piled on right now. I&#39;m not terribly worried since I&#39;ve got good
                    grades in all of my classes, and my projects that are heavier work (Unity ones) I managed to get an
                    extension on. I hate to admit that Copilot is perfect for coding prototype stuff
                    <b><u>really</u></b> fast, especially since my brain isn&#39;t a coder one (funny how I decided to
                    code a whole website then), and it&#39;s been easing up a lot of the stress I&#39;ve had with this
                    game project. Making curling into a VR game is ... <i>weird</i>, but I&#39;ve got an idea, and
                    it&#39;s slowly shaping into something more solid. Thankfully, it&#39;s only a prototype, so I&#39;m
                    not going super in-depth.

                    The other is just interactables, and it might take me more to make some shitty and quick ProBuilder
                    models to do a base colour on, vs just having physics based items you interact with to simulate the
                    tea-making industrial process (which surprisingly is still very hands-on, this
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqDk2swTiB8">wonderful video</a> by Wu Mountain Tea is what
                    I&#39;m going to base it off, and probably do the oolong tea process in a more simplified version.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Aside from that, working on this site has helped me to understand HTML/CSS better, though Javascript
                    is still a mystifying beast to me. Most likely because I know nothing about the syntax they use for
                    functions and things. Like I understand at a vague level (duh, I had C# drilled into my brain for
                    years in Game Design), but otherwise ... icky, <i>spooky</i>. Still a lot to do, and I&#39;m very
                    stumped on how I wanna handle OC profiles. It might be the one instance where I do make a different
                    CSS layout just for OCs and place them in a folder to figure that out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Otherwise, I do hope to get some work done on that because I wanna join the yume ring that&#39;s
                    here, but it requires a completed shrine. I guess if I think about it, shrines are also ways to make
                    new css/HTML layouts for something you like to dedicate to it. I do really like ... yeah yeah, it is
                    <b>homogenizing</b>, but I do like consistency across the look of a website for anything that
                    isn&#39;t a special page. I have mad respect for the people who can make new layouts for pages,
                    cause I definitely could never (both in energy and my brain fighting against it). Part of me wonders
                    if I can just reuse my &lt;intro&gt; and &lt;aside&gt; sections and modify them with my existing
                    CSS, but also blehhhh. If there&#39;s a code that allows you to &#39;merge&#39; columns (aka have
                    one div that spans two of your defined columns) I might be able to just use my old CSS, but some
                    part of me also just wants to say fuck it and just make an altered version only for OCs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I do have <a href="https://toyhou.se/">Toyhouse</a> for all of them, and I prefer that as my OC hub
                    for hosting everything + uploading all of my art and commissions, but I think it&#39;d be so cool to
                    make something a little more custom (I say as if my layout isn&#39;t inspo&#39;d by the CSS layout I
                    have on there, which speaking of I should credit in my footer as inspo). I most likely will end up
                    doing the same for my character layouts, or see what other people have done on here, or see if any
                    existing templates I can adjust/gut to work with my current CSS ... anyway, plans and plans.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I should be playing the new HSR update, but I&#39;ve been <i>so</i> sucked into either website work,
                    or school work. Hell, even poor Minecraft got left behind which was my fixation ... but that&#39;s
                    it for now!! Till next time I get brainworms I need to offload.
