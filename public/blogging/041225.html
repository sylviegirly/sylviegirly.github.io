    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                    <em>&mdash;<time datetime="2025-04-12"> April 12, 2025</time></em>
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    On the topic of ADHD ... it&#39;s still something I&#39;m rolling around in my brain; it&#39;s only
                    been in the last 6&ndash;8 months that I&#39;ve really settled with the idea that I may most likely
                    have inattentive ADHD ... I don&#39;t have a way of getting assessed for it (not until I move out
                    anyway), but my head has been deep into videos and research and what not, and helping a friend
                    realize she also most likely has it (and her scoring high on an actual assessment test) also settled
                    it in my own brain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It&#39;s kinda funny cause I&#39;ve had someone point out some posts I&#39;ve made (on tumblr) align
                    a lot with ADHD in the past, and I was there like &#39;haha it&#39;s a mood, but I don&#39;t have
                    it&#39; while also finding myself nodding and agreeing with other posts people made about their
                    ADHD/neurodivergent moods and experiences ... and while thinking &#39;yeah, I feel that a lot, but I
                    probably don&#39;t have it as bad as other people&#39;.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At least until I saw
                    <a href="https://sylviegirly.tumblr.com/post/765567124634763264">this post</a>
                    and something made it click in a way where I was like <i>&#39;oh&#39;</i>.
                </p>
                <img
                    class="full-width-image"
                    src="https://i.imgur.com/jJer7Fp.png"
                    alt="a tumblr screenshot, the first post writes: generally speaking when it comes to mental and physical health, if you're asked 'do you struggle with this' and your answer is 'no, Because I Have A System,' then your answer is actually yes" />
                <p>
                    Because ... I&#39;ve had a lot of systems I put in place over the years. Reminders for my
                    &#39;subpar memory&#39; even for minor tasks like showering, setting tiny work amounts (pomodoro),
                    always relying on background noise, running timers for even small things like my tea steeping, doing
                    things on call with my friend, schedules, doing things half-way and at least taking stride in that
                    over nothing at all, subconscious fidgeting, putting things in easy access and view, and probably
                    other things I can&#39;t quite think of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And it&#39;s funny because my long-term bestie of 8+ years now told me &#39;I always thought you had
                    it&#39; or something akin to basically having it like a red stamp on my forehead LOOOL. On top of
                    other people also pointing it out, and that the love and fixation I have for Sylvie is definitely
                    beyond the norm (for a normal, neurotypical person anyway). Obviously growing on the internet, being
                    fixated on your own OCs and fictional faves wasn&#39;t unusual to me so it&#39;s why that didn&#39;t
                    seem <i>weird</i> to me, and that normal not-online people either way aren&#39;t weird about their
                    own characters (if they even make any) but yeah. Never really clicked.
                </p>

                <p>But it feels like an answer to a lot of things of how I am.</p>

                <p>
                    My memory <i>is</i> terrible, yesterday blends into the past, and it&#39;s blurry. I remember going
                    to a cool food festival event with some coworkers and having the time of my life ... but as soon as
                    I get home/the next day, the event feels like it happened so long ago, like years. Things don&#39;t
                    feel real in particular, even though I know I was there, there&#39;s some weird disconnect that I
                    never really have been able to change. And I&#39;m sad because many fun events I know I&#39;ve
                    enjoyed myself at, I have no memories of if I never noted them down in some form (pictures,
                    writings), or if they were significant enough. And even those blend: ex. we&#39;ve been to Cuba
                    multiple times on vacation and I remember general strokes and chunks like me finding a living
                    starfish, but if you asked me which of those trips it was, I could not tell you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I remembered a friend&#39;s birthday once because she shared it with my favourite fictional
                    character at the time, otherwise I need to write them down in my reminders to remember, even if I
                    love them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Time blindness is a <b>bitch</b>, and so is <b>task paralysis</b> (spinning random wheels/coin flips
                    are a nice solution for that).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am cursed to enjoy staring new projects and the hype and fixation rush (to be fair, this site is
                    one right now!!), but to not have the capability to carry most projects to their completion without
                    either working in a team, or having deadlines imposed on me with consequences due to stress
                    overwriting the ADHD part of the brain (I do not look at the amount of projects I began around
                    Sylvie, like a visual novel and RPG Maker game that are half done).
                </p>

                <p>
                    My thoughts are jumbled and messy and jump in places, I can go from topic to topic without finding
                    it weird, I like using my own experiences to connect to situations. To be fair, recognizing that it
                    most likely is ADHD that is causing this has helped me view things in a different light. Why I
                    struggle to want to start something, why I like having an item here but not there, what works for my
                    focus and when my focus is absolutely shot (I usually try to do 10&ndash;20 minutes of work even
                    then, sometimes even just <i>starting</i> is enough to get me to do a little more work than
                    planned).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I tried to journal, but both physical and digital journals flopped for me (I know I do not have to
                    write in them every day, but if I don&#39;t try to keep consistency in some form, I then forget to
                    do the thing ... as soon as I slip, I usually stop doing it). Audio journaling has been good to
                    thought dump without feeling some looming pressure to write, or want to decorate, and I don&#39;t
                    feel the need to do it daily.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Aside from that, I usually rely on my phone reminders and timers to keep some semblance of
                    organization in my life, and I like organizing things in other facets of my life to scratch an itch
                    (like this site, my tumblr blog, my Notion, etc).
                </p>

                <p>But here are some of the tools I&#39;ve liked to use:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://structured.app/">Structured</a> &mdash; a scheduling app, I use it on and off,
                        but I really like how it visualizes your free time + how your day is filled; it&#39;s indie made
                        as well
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.screenzen.co/">ScreenZen</a> &mdash; to avoid the time blindness pitfall
                        and to just help scrolling habits in general (or not getting lost in Cookie Run games for
                        2&mdash;3 hours), also an indie app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.untoldapp.com/">Untold</a>&nbsp;&mdash; my audio journaling app, sadly only
                        for iOS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a>&nbsp;&mdash; I&#39;ve fallen off using Habitica and
                        already migrated my whole system to iOS&#39;s native Reminders, but it&#39;s honestly a pretty
                        good interactive habit tracker/to-do for those who&#39;d like a little RPG aspect to it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzGzwTY-6w">Brown noise</a>
                        (sometimes
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7pFajGkDHs">with rain</a>)&nbsp;&mdash; good for
                        anything I need to focus on intensely and don&#39;t want voices for (since otherwise I rely on
                        YouTube videos), case in point with me writing this blog
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some of my favourite YouTubers for information:</p>

                <p>
                    Not too sure what else to say outside of ... adult ADHD being hard to diagnose sucks!! I think I
                    know where mine came from if it is genetic (staring holes into my own dad), but it&#39;s definitely
                    not something like I feel like I can bring up with my own family. Thankfully the online sphere is
                    full of wonderful people, and information to see and get from people who genuinely have it as well,
                    so ... I am glad I&#39;ve learned a little more about myself and understand myself a little better
                    through it. Perhaps one day I can get a full confirmation (hard not to have the lingering doubts
                    about faking it eugh), but until then I learn what works for me, and helps my brain a little more.
                </p>
