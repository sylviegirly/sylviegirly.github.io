    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                    Journaling and the Struggles
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <em>&mdash;<time datetime="2025-06-04"> June 4, 2025</time></em>
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    The title probably isn't&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> the wording of it, but yesterday was the first time I
                    wrote in my physical journal after 6 months of not doing it; my last entry was mid-December, but I
                    sorely needed to dump my thoughts out somewhere more tangible. I do still want to pick up physical
                    journaling for the tactile feel of writing and truly having a non-digital way to blurt out my
                    thoughts or the mundane things of life, I do realize I also already do journal in many different
                    facets, which is probably why it also makes it harder to feel the need to physically journal.
                </p>
                <p>Cause I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write here on this blog to thought dump in a more cohesive manner</li>
                    <li>Use status.cafe to offload 'at the moment' thoughts so they don't sit in my skull</li>
                    <li>
                        Have my <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/listfauxgraphy/">listography page</a> for
                        scattered ideas in one area
                    </li>
                    <li>Write on tumblr to also offload momentary thoughts in a more public/interactive place</li>
                    <li>Talk to friends to offload thoughts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ... but I still want to do physical journaling to have something in my hands that I can look back
                    on; it was fun flipping through my journal and seeing what I wrote about 6 months ago, plus I like
                    decorating it with stickers. Though I think the urge to be uh ... what's the word ... to have a
                    pretty looking journal brought me as well to a weird barrier, as well as feeling the need to do it
                    daily and needing to write more than just a single line or two. As fun as it is looking through how
                    others do their own for inspiration, it's hard not to feel a trickle of the&nbsp;<em>need</em>
                    to join in, and write that much, and have nice journals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, I'm going to force myself to at least write&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;a line, and no more. A
                    simple highlight of the day. If I need to write more, I will, if I don't ... I don't and just leave
                    it to the next day for another highlight. If I want to do stickers, I will, but I&nbsp;<span
                        style="text-decoration: underline"
                        >need</span
                    >
                    to not make myself think it needs them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Journaling is&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> hard with ADHD, but it can definitely be done in a lot of
                    different forms; I've seen people who have digital diaries logged on their sites, or /now pages
                    documenting what's been happening, or status updates, and so on. There's definitely catharsis and
                    something about having a document of your life somewhere tangible, either in HTML, or handwritten.
                    Especially as someone with subpar memory, it helps to be able to look back on a part of the past and
                    know it happened, and what was going on then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, this is me just rambling about my recognition of journaling in different forms and the
                    desire to try to pick up handwritten journaling again.
