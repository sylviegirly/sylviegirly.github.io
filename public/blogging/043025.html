    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                    Nostalgia for MMOs
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <em>&mdash;<time datetime="2025-04-30"> April 30, 2025</time></em>
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    Sighs, game nostalgia ... though mine usually always swirls around the old MMOs I used to play.
                    Well, one isn&#39;t even all that old, considering I only quit it just 1&ndash;2 years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love <a href="https://elsword.koggames.com">Elsword</a> still as a game, but I miss the old era of
                    it, when the level cap wasn&#39;t 99, it was 60, when the newest character was my future main
                    LuCiel, when the graphics and UI were chunky and dungeons took 10 minutes to clear vs the 2 minutes
                    they take now. And it sucks because the private servers I&#39;ve found rarely ever capture the
                    essence of that time in the 2012-2015 era (minus one I just <i>literally</i> found that&#39;s
                    <a href="https://www.classicels.com/">barely getting its legs as of April 25th</a>) because most
                    move to the modern game, which I dislike.

                <p>
                    There&#39;s a tinge of nostalgia that lingers for that era of 2013 Elsword, and for the time I used
                    to play <a href="https://www.playpwi.com/en">Perfect World International</a> too, one which has so
                    many private servers that it&#39;s not hard to find one covering the classic era I played it in
                    (also in the 2010-2013 range), but unlike Elsword ... trying to play it ends up with me just
                    dropping it a couple of days later. Some servers allow you to boost to level cap, but I don&#39;t
                    see the joy in that when I never got to level cap and experienced endgame; to me, I liked the idea
                    of leveling and going through dungeons on my own, but even in private servers that have a boost in
                    EXP, it still unfortunately feels tedious and clunky and awkward!!!

                <p>
                    And it makes me sad, because Perfect World International has SUCH a gorgeous landscape,
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/H0YuBmN6nNM">beautiful music</a> I still enjoy tenderly to this day, and
                    allowed you to take a mount and fly across the entire map if you wanted to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It&#39;s a nostalgia, but it&#39;s one that makes me sad to some degree because I wish I could enjoy
                    those games like I did when I was young, where I remember losing hours staying up late to play and
                    grind, with the guilds I used to be in ... and perhaps It&#39;s because I don&#39;t have the people
                    anymore that brought light to those games that makes it so much harder to get back into them. I
                    don&#39;t mind solo grinding, but a lot of my fun was in partaking in guild PVP fights and running
                    dungeons and just talking with people while playing dress-up with my cute fox-girl summoner (funnily
                    enough my nostalgia here was from a private server, I never got far in the official game and instead
                    opted to play long-term in a private server).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elsword I just straight up quit alongside my bestie, so that&#39;s less a case of
                    <i>community</i> and more a case that there aren&#39;t many private servers that cover the era we
                    both knew. Otherwise, the game as it is <b>sucks</b>, more in terms that raids and continual
                    enhancements have made the game a riddled, pay-to-win elitist mess, where if you decided to main the
                    &#39;wrong class&#39; people don&#39;t want you in the most recent raids (case in point, my class
                    was considered a sub-par DPS and only could work alongside a second DPS instead of carrying a raid
                    like other more <i>powerful</i> DPS classes, so I was shafted a lot when it came to finding raid
                    parties vs my friend who played a support that was always in demand ... and since we were a duo
                    pair, and we didn&#39;t go into separate parties, it made progressing in the game stressful because
                    of how people were about it).

                    I&#39;m glad FFXIV (even if on hiatus for me at the moment) fills a lot of that hole of an MMO I can
                    see myself dedicating time into ... and that I already have; although it cannot replace the ache and
                    longing for those games of the past, at least it can give me something new to pour myself into.
                </p>

                    Although it makes me sad to think about sometimes, I&#39;m glad there are places trying to preserve
                    the older times, even if the people that made those times good are gone now, it doesn&#39;t hurt to
                    live a little bit of nostalgia before shelving it again.

                    (I realize this is the same case with Club Penguin for me, a deeply nostalgic game, but I can't play
                    it anymore like I used to because it's such a community centric game, and doing stuff on your own is
                    only so much fun)
