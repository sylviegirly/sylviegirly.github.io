    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                <p>
                    <em>&mdash;<time datetime="2025-05-28"> May 28, 2025</time></em>
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    Not too sure where I wanna go with this, but I was mostly just thinking about how my main OC(s) end
                    up having a lot more overlaps with me than I sometimes realize, and I realize far too late about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mostly cause I realize ... <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/sylvie">Sylvie</a> has a
                    thought process where they don't think that people will remember them. Obviously they are a god who
                    <em>has</em> been forgotten/left behind, so their train of thought isn't all too surprising,
                    especially when they will outlive even human companions that have a short hundred-year lifespan to
                    cram people and events and things. But I realized today that I ... also struggle with
                    conceptualizing that people think of me outside a bubble, if that makes sense. It's weird to wrap my
                    brain around the concept that I can be admired, or talked about outside of conversations ... I guess
                    kinda like ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    God fuck it all cycles
                    <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/object-permanence-and-adhd.html">back to ADHD</a>
                    doesn't it LMFAO, I was gonna say it's like object permanence and the idea of being out of sight,
                    out of mind. If it's the case, it's probably why it's hard for me to imagine that I remain in
                    people's memories or that people admire me/things I've done, cause my own brain is lost in its own
                    world until I have visual reminders of someone/something (even though I also have people I admire
                    for what they've done, I dunno why my brain just has a blocker thinking the other way around).
                </p>
                <p>... and I only realize this now fully in looking at my own OC.</p>
                <p>
                    Obviously, there's more than just that, Sylvie emulates a lot of the energy I'd <em>like</em> to
                    have, though my pool of energy is very subpar 99% of the time. Also ENFP (them) vs INFP (me), a love
                    of trying out new things, of food, and ... y'know, getting the ADHD beam after I began researching
                    it for myself. Though ironically, unlike my suspected inattentive ADHD, theirs is hyperactivity and
                    moving at 100% almost all the time and being unable to sit still.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/hideki">Hideki</a> was the other main OC I had for 7
                    years before Sylvie took that mantle, and because he had been with me for so long (literally through
                    high-school and my college years), he's absorbed a <em>lot</em> from me.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>INFP personality type</li>
                    <li>Gamers</li>
                    <li>Subpar confidence from back then and bad social anxiety</li>
                    <li>Overthinkers</li>
                    <li>Love language is cooking</li>
                    <li>Easily emotional and turning to crying to cope</li>
                    <li>Tries their best to be nice to everyone, surprised when it's returned</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I lived a lot through him in a way, in his successes and his sadness as an outlet.</p>
                <p>... so yeah ... har har, boo boo the fool is I ...</p>
                <p>
                    Although my other big OCs (<a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/yadyra">Yadyra</a> and
                    <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/nameless">Nameless</a>) do not have that emotional
                    tie-in to my heart as coping mechanisms, and considering how much they are their own characters
                    standing on their own feet (also immensely non-human and <em>not</em> like my personality at all),
                    parts of me still slip in. Hell, food as a joy will always tend to remain in all my characters, even
                    if they don't need to eat, or they're more specific enjoyments (inside joke between a friend and I
                    is that Yadyra currently has a burrito obsession).
                </p>
                <p>Anyway! Incoherent blog post yapping that you bleed in over your OCs more than you realize ü´£</p>
