    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                    I dunno why it spooks me to write about it, I guess because there's some part of me that still feels
                    like I'm a black sheep, because I only have being ace to my name, and some part of me worries about
                    being seen as 'invading' due to still IDing as cis, and heteroromantic, or that my aceness isn't
                    valid because of it (and god knows I've also seen my share of aphobia, not towards myself but in
                    general from even within LGBTQ+ communities).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not that I haven't questioned how I personally feel about my own gender, cause unironically
                    I've found
                    <a
                        href="https://sylviegirly.tumblr.com/post/100048176672/i-sometimes-idk-what-gender-i-am-like-idk-how-to"
                        >a Tumblr post</a
                    >
                    from way back in 2014 when I was ~16 years old talking about it.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>i sometimes&ndash; idk what gender i am? like idk how to classify myself</p>
                    <p>i know im a girl and i feel like a girl but&hellip; i dont too?</p>
                    <p>like i dont care that im a girl</p>
                    <p>i accept it but just&hellip; shrugs towards the gender????</p>
                    <p>maybe demigirl?????</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    I've sat and thought about it and ruminated and revisited it over the years, and still circle back
                    that I'm ok with just IDing as a girl, even if in concept it's not really integral to me/not
                    something I'm deeply connected to; it's like a container full of one type of goop (feminine) but
                    it's an immensely muted colour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Funnily enough, I lived more gender euphoria through exploring
                    <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/sylvie">Sylvie's</a> gender identity (considering in the
                    years I've had them it's shifted from masc he/they, to fully agender they/them&mdash;since he/him
                    for them made me feel uncomfortable&mdash;to finding a wild joy in they/she and how much I feel that
                    it fits them&nbsp;<em>perfectly</em>),
                    <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/hideki">Hideki's</a> exploration of presenting himself
                    as more fem and that it makes him happy, and finding
                    <a href="https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cassgender">cassgender</a> cause it hit the nail on the head
                    how I feel about myself; although I am comfortable IDing as a girl, and it is my identity I am also
                    comfy with, I feel disconnected to being it/it's not a huge part of how I see myself.
                </p>

                    <i
                        >(Might also kinda speak to why a lot of my OCs are agender, or don't see it as important to
                        their own identities.)</i

                    As for romantic interest ... I think I like guys by the process of elimination more than anything
                    (no attraction to girls, single IRL crush was a guy, I like fictional men&mdash;though I do have
                    some fictional women I like, ex. Acheron who I like more in awe of cause I
                    <em>love</em> her as a character). Truthfully I also have very little interest in the concept of
                    dating, though I think the concept of more romantic interactions is cute (albeit I think romance, if
                    pursued, needs a basis of friendship and someone you'd trust to talk about with stuff like you would
                    with friends ... I don't see much of a difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship,
                    minus some additional aspects ... and I mean this in the sense for myself, everyone views the two in
                    their own personal ways).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I feel muddied and bland with my own self, I love seeing other people, and the characters
                    people make, and what they are and what is comfortable to them. I love learning about different
                    identities and how one expresses themselves and how they best feel comfortable in whom (or what)
                    they are, I love seeing people's posts about their progress, transitions, their thoughts and ideas
                    and posts talking about themselves, of stories from people who are in their old ages who have found
                    new pieces of themselves or the openness to be themselves after so long. And I hope everyone finds
                    somewhere safe they can exist, considering the state of the world today (and even before today too).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not really a coherent blog post, it's more akin to a verbal and personal diary dump in trying to
                    sort out my thoughts (maybe I need to rename this section to blog/diary) ... and who knows, maybe
                    like that Tumblr post from earlier, I'll revisit this later down in my life and see how I feel.
                    Something in my chest feels a little lighter talking about it, putting it into words that I know
                    won't quite as easily disappear under the copious amounts of posts on my own blog.
