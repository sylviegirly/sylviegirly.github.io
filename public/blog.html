    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                    <p>
                        TIL abt the concept of
                        <a href="https://winreyplace.neocities.org/library/what-is-munbonding-03-04-2025">munbonding</a>
                        ... and i guess it's kinda what i have with <a href="oc/sylvie/index.html">sylvie</a>, and what
                        i had with <a href="oc/hideki/index.html">hideki</a> when he was still active. i always feel odd
                        considering these kinda terms for myself, esp since i'm very aware they are just characters in
                        my skull, and that they are in a way coping for me to have someone to talk to
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i just have no other way to put it into words outside of 'this green freak sometimes appears and
                        throws stupid comments out while i'm doing things' and that they react immediately instead of me
                        needing to imagine how they'd react; its so weird to describe it. freaky imaginary friend who does
                        whatever they want when i think of them and blinks cutely (fond)
                    </p>
                    <p>that does make me wonder why the term imaginary friend isnt used more often ... is it because you see them more as imaginary? even though their origin is your mind? either way, can of worms to unpack and makes me just wonder why imaginary friend isnt used more</p>
                    <p>even so, still interesting to learn about</p>

                            sometimes i wonder if people would notice if i disappear. i don't mean in the suicidal
                            sense, more in the sense of just disappearing off a social media. sometimes it does ache a
                            little to see mutuals very 'omg i love you guys!' with lists of other mutuals i also have,
                            but i'm not there because i'm not social enough as those people, when even ones who have
                            disappeared off the feed and come back get a giant fanfare
                        </p>
                        <p>do people notice they're gone...?</p>

                            it does suck a little to be reminded that i don't have the energy output to keep up like
                            those people do. i don't have the brain capacity to offer gifts or art or questions/asks, or
                            give the same peppy OMGGG I LOVE THIS UR SO GORGEOUS [goes on for 20 more lines] energy

                        the maddening thing sylvie hates (loves) about zhongli is that he's the type of person when
                        playing games/cards pretends to be so oblivious about it while he's beating their ass at the
                        current match
                    </p>
                    <p>bats his eyelashes and he's just 'perhaps it's merely luck being on my side'</p>
                    <p>
                        all they want to do is strangle every cubic inch of air out of him and know they cant because
                        he'd just enjoy it

                    <p>
                        ouuhgghhh i'm gonna be so mad and super fucking petty right now cause this is my hole and i'm
                        gonna read more it for the sake of not exploding, so below is me complaining abt zhongli ship
                        (y/n mostly) dynamics. i just needed to get it off my skull somewhere
                    </p>

                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            but oh my god why are 99% of the zhongli y/n situations so NOT HIM. I DON'T SEE HIM DATING A
                            HUMAN. I DON'T SEE HIM DATING A PAST LOVER INCARNATED, WHY WOULD HE SUBJECT HIMSELF TO THE
                            TRAUMA OF LOSS LIKE THAT!!!!! THE PERSON REINCARNATED =/= THE PAST PERSON, THEY ARE THEIR
                            OWN ENTITY!!!!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            YEAH YEAH EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN BARBIE DOLL INTERPRETATIONS BUT I CANT SEE THIS MAN DOING
                            THAT!!!!!!!!!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            anyway sorry i have a lot of emotions abt this man and all the loss he's experienced through
                            losing both people and other adepti and other old friends like azhdaha, and i just cannot
                            see this man ever choosing to date someone whose lifespan is the equivalent of a drop in the
                            water to him!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            like MAYBE you can argue it's like wanting to see a flower bloom and to experience a
                            fleeting moment that is all yours to cherish, but like ... again, he's went through the
                            archon war, he's went through the cataclysm, HE WAS ACHING AT LOSING AZHDAHA. THIS IS A MAN
                            WHO BOTH WANTS TO RELEASE THE PAST FROM HIMSELF (rex lapis) AND WANTS TO AVOID CLINGING TO
                            IT BECAUSE IT'S A DANGEROUS, SLIPPERY SLOPE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'VE DUG MY OWN SELFMADE HELLHOLE TO HAVE A SHIP OF GOD X GOD CAUSE NO ONE DOES THAT DYNAMIC
                            WITH HIM FOR ME TO ACTUALLY GET ZHONGVIE CONTENT OUT OF IT!!!!!! ASIDE FROM ZHONGVEN BUT
                            THAT'S A SHIP AND IT'S IN MY MUTED TAG. AND EVEN WHEN I DO SEE IT, RARELY EVER FITS FOR THEM
                            BECAUSE THE Y/N IS SO 'omg ur just a small god compared to him' OR SOME OTHER POSITION OF
                            POWER THAT NEVER PUTS THEM ON AN EQUAL FOOTING AT ALL
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            things i will never say on socmed cause i'd be blown into literal smithereens for being the
                            no-fun police (I KNOW IT'S PETTY I KNOW, IT'S THE CURSE OF A BLORBO FIXATION FOR 4 YEARS)

                        Another rambly think piece; I guess my blogs end up being more of a dissection of my own self
                        more than anything, or a study piece of something ... but I didn&#39;t always used to have such
                        a divide of the personal self, and the &#39;art&#39; self.

                        <p>
                            Back when I was active on deviantART, I just had the single account where I yapped about
                            things I liked, and posted my art and fics too. There was no barrier between
                            <em>myself</em> and <em>the artist</em>, and even when I first moved onto tumblr, I posted
                            all of my art for the most part on my personal account, or my roleplaying account (which you
                            can argue is also &#39;personal&#39; and &#39;art&#39; combined).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At some point I ended up making an art tumblr to upload and store all my art to, but it
                            wasn&#39;t used much since I still preferred posting on my roleplaying blogs that I was
                            consistently on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It wasn&#39;t until joining twitter in the ... 2017-2018 era ... that something changed. To
                            be fair, Twitter nuking your media to a shitty gallery didn&#39;t help, but I still posted
                            my art on my personal twitter. I also began doing commissions at the end of 2017, and
                            eventually began to move from pet site currency commissions to actual money commissions in a
                            few years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So it was hard to really facilitate art commissions from a Twitter account that I kept
                            private just to keep it to my own hidey hole, and it didn&#39;t really work to have my
                            roleplaying blog be an official &quot;art&quot; account either, nor did my personal blog
                            really feel appropriate as a landing page for people when I&#39;m here reblogging the
                            &#39;do you like the colours of the sky&#39; and pictures of plinko horse gifs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So by necessity my art accounts came into being, that were just art, and some chatting here
                            and there from me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s so weird because I ... don&#39;t mind when other artists are vocal on their
                            accounts, and reblog things that have zero relationship to their art because they are just
                            people with interests. But I can&#39;t do that to my own. It&#39;s so hard to be open on my
                            art accounts, outside of tiny spurts, because I have a mental barrier of a &#39;persona&#39;
                            when it comes to how I portray myself as an artist. It&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t yapped
                            about things I like (god knows you can find me being unhinged on my Bluesky over zhongvie,
                            tags does help for that), but I always feel like I have some need to curate everything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Twitter definitely hasn&#39;t helped with having basically no way to filter out just the
                            artwork ... Bluesky has helped with having feeds and functional tags but ... (vaguely
                            gestures to the ongoing censorship shitshow). Sheezyart is great but it feels more like a
                            gallery than anywhere to really be unhinged. Tumblr I have already my personal blog of 13
                            years, I don&#39;t have a need to talk on my art blog there. Pillowfort is probably the
                            closest where I also feel more able to talk, like Bluesky.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It also doesn&#39;t help that I tend to have immensely low social energy now, and tend to
                            find it the easiest to be vocal on my personal tumblr, that&#39;s 99% just random crap
                            (fondly). And it sucks because artists being personal is what&#39;s appealing to people!!
                            I&#39;d love to yap there!!! But I have such a mental barrier around it, that it makes it
                            hard!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And it sucks because it&#39;s <em>you</em> that draws people in. Pretty art is nice, but it
                            helps to know the artist beyond that. People do get <em>me</em> on those, but not in full.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And I <em>want</em> to keep personal and &#39;professional&#39; separated, its why all my
                            personal accounts have slowly migrated to not be under <em>Asuraid</em>, but under things
                            like zhongvie, or sylviegirly. It&#39;s easier to reblog my own art to a personal account,
                            for the people who are cool with me being unhinged and uninhibited there, and leaving it as
                            just art and a more neutral self on my art accounts.

                            A personal part of me is always on display even on my art because my art is centered around
                            Sylvie, who is my comfort character.

                            I dunno if I have a concrete point to this blog, in particular, outside of this: man, it
                            sure sucks to juggle persona masks sometimes, but I very explicitly want a divide between my
                            &#39;work&#39; and my &#39;self&#39;. Anyway to those who are on my personal site/blog,
                            congrats! You get the full unfiltered self.

                        does masking count for trying to appear functional online and peppy when ur just a shambling
                        emotional mess. sighs, i think 'customer service' as a freelance artist definitely contributes
                        to that i suppose

                        As per usual, probably a messy incoherence of a thought stream;
                        <a href="https://zhongvie.bearblog.dev/2025-05-23/">my blog about my own identity</a>
                        touched upon this a bit, but I thought I&#39;d get a little more ... in-depth I guess? I&#39;m
                        always a little nervous talking about it because I ID as cis (minor aside for
                        <a href="https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cassgender">cassgender / cassgirl</a>, and maybe aligning
                        to some degree to <a href="https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Demigender#Subgenders">demigirl</a> if
                        you use the &#39;barest association with being a girl&#39; description) and some part of me
                        always worries if I&#39;m overstepping on toes in discussing gender, or how I discuss it, or
                        exploring it.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="oc/hideki/index.html">Hideki</a> was my first exploration into him being less
                            conforming to his gender; he&#39;s a cis guy through and through, but has always loved
                            feminine fashion, makeup, looking cute, but has always felt a strong divide with that
                            because of his history (a mother who&#39;s always wanted a daughter and has basically
                            berated him and put him down, and the daughter she did have after him died in an accident).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Is it because <em>he</em> wants it? Or is it because of what his mother has wanted to push
                            upon him? Is it weird to want to do that? Him living in Japan + having a same-sex
                            relationship has always brought up conflict and shame in how he wants to be himself, and
                            usually always kept it buried, or locked in the not-so-metaphorical closet. By the end
                            he&#39;s embraced it, although he still dresses more for comfort and hiding old scars, pinks
                            and whites bleed into his outfits, and as a streamer he openly embraces more of that part
                            and allows it to be more public online (vs in person).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through Hideki I&#39;ve learned to embrace what you like, and to be a little gentler to
                            yourself. Hideki was also my first foray into deep research into BPD, since he ended up
                            exhibiting personality signs of it. Talking to people who have it and were open to offering
                            their experiences, researching blogs that posted about their experiences, videos, articles
                            on therapy and the steps of therapy for it, medicines and what could help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s always a little scary to depict something that isn&#39;t <em>you</em>, and it&#39;s
                            why I sometimes have anxiety talking about even exploring gender through my OCs, because its
                            personal to who a person is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s so odd that with sexuality/romance I feel more comfortable exploring, but perhaps
                            it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been dabbling in it longer, with my first real prominent OC I made
                            when I was like ... 14 being bi, and being exposed to the concept of different sexualities
                            early on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Characters that explored gender I didn&#39;t encounter until much later while in the
                            roleplaying scene, and even to this day many characters I encountered tend to only err on
                            the nonbinary spectrum, with very few being trans, or fluid (and just as few who fall on any
                            aro and/or ace spectrum). Many people didn&#39;t talk about their personal experiences on
                            their roleplay blogs, so I got a lot less exposure to it until I really decided to make
                            Sylvie and returned to being more social on my personal/art socmeds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="oc/sylvie/index.html">Sylvie</a> is my first real dive into exploring it more
                            in-depth, in having a character that&#39;s changed their ... not entirely their whole
                            identity over the time ... but most of my OCs up until that point haven&#39;t changed much
                            in how they felt about their gender or how they identified (not counting Cotton who I
                            changed semi-recently from he/him to they/them to it/they).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of my close friends I met through RPing is NB themselves (and since then I&#39;ve been
                            exposed to a lot more friends and mutuals who are NB/fluid/etc), and their OC (who Hideki
                            basically thinks of as a sibling/family) is agender. And because of knowing them, and
                            knowing this OC for years, I felt comfortable enough feeling out agender for Sylvie when I
                            made them. Sadly because it&#39;s 4 years ago, I can&#39;t say I remember my exact train of
                            thought outside of &#39;I don&#39;t think they&#39;d really care about gender, they see
                            themselves as just Sylvie&#39;.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I know we&#39;ve also talked that agender and aro/ace characters tend to be misgendered and
                            have people try to push ships/sexual relations on them (I&#39;ve seen it with Sylvie, people
                            have used he/him for them despite it being in my bio that it isn&#39;t, and my friend&#39;s
                            OC who&#39;s she/her but agender keeps getting fem terms used which they&#39;ve stated
                            isn&#39;t accurate for her), which I guess was also another fuel for me to continue
                            exploring it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s almost funny how fast I dropped he/him for Sylvie when it felt gross to see it used
                            for them. Felt wrong. And they/them is what they remained. From Hideki&#39;s love of
                            dressing up in dresses and make-up, it bled to Sylvie as well. They like it because it just
                            feels nice, it makes them feel pretty to be in a short-cut cute dress, just as much as a
                            sexy suit combo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And it&#39;s only in the last year I&#39;ve really ... like stupid giggly found out I
                            <em>really</em> like she/her for Sylvie too. Like a puzzle piece that fits perfectly that
                            has me kicking my feet and blushing whenever it&#39;s used for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I still tend to use just they/them in writing because it&#39;s been 4 years of doing that,
                            but know they are the most girl-thing they/she to me who could crush me and I&#39;d thank
                            them. It also introduced me to
                            <a href="https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Libragender#Subterms">librafeminine</a>
                            as a gender (though sometimes they even feel closer to demigirl to me, but truthfully both
                            work in their own ways; librafeminine just fits them a little more because of being agender
                            primarily).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their own confidence in their appearance and self, and embracing their own femineity has
                            helped me be a little more connected to my own, even if I don&#39;t necessarily ... err,
                            feel connected to it. Contradictory, but I dunno if it makes sense. On top of being a little
                            more comfortable with body hair (giving them a bush for my own coping, but it&#39;s also
                            because I&#39;m tired of baby smooth everything down there).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wish I could put the exact words into it but it just puts me through some stupidly giggly
                            euphoria looking at them looking as they are, but comfortably preferring to be called a
                            gorgeous lady because it&#39;s just so <em>them</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would love to in the future explore more fluid characters, or trans characters ... I cook
                            OCs immensely slowly though, and especially with how personal some stories can be and how
                            they can reflect the experiences of real people, I&#39;d want to do it justice and not just
                            have it be an OC that becomes sidelined because my fixation is elsewhere (considering it
                            took 7-8 years for Hideki to wind down as my comfort/fixation OC, and Sylvie&#39;s been
                            going as that for 4 years now).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But until then, I do lovingly admire all the OCs people make, and the experiences people
                            have, because it lights up my world a little more with the colours of others.

                    <p>
                        sometimes being in a yume community really sucks when you don't have the energy to post about
                        your ship or interact as frequently as others (and subsequently only have a single ship vs
                        people who have a lot of ships they can talk about over many other fandoms), and that after 4
                        years of having said ship, there's very little you can say which you haven't said already or
                        discussed in DMs. or draw enough to post about them. or have income to commission them instead
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        it just feels a little lonely being on my tumblr feed sometimes when i see all my mutuals just
                        sending stuff to each other, and that i have little drive or desire to do that for others. it
                        feels like i'm the issue. some of it makes it hard to interact because it's fandoms i know
                        nothing about; i can't go insane over their ships bc i have no context or emotional connection.
                        and again, makes me feel like i'm the issue or not trying hard enough
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        and it sucks cause tumblr is my last real social media i'm active on that's a personal account,
                        and not me interacting through my art accounts, so hitting these ruts sucks ass
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        it'll pass (i've gotten to the point of not caring about it and sometimes interaction does come
                        more fluidly, but sometimes the emotions win out), just annoying to feel it. maybe i need to
                        reduce some of my yapping on stuff like status.cafe and just post more frequently there

                            sometimes the community is also like 110% horny over stuff too, and don't get me wrong i've
                            written and tagged some <i>nasty</i> stuff for zhongvie cause they're nowhere near vanilla
                            and i've done art/writing that's NSFW, but it's so abundant too that it also makes it hard
                            to just engage when it's all 'your f/o eats you out like this' or creampies or just writing
                            that's x reader NSFW stuff which i've never engaged in for the most part (most x reader fics
                            of zhongli suck sorry, i'm so tired of shitty yandere fics about him or x reader is some

                        After using <a href="https://obsidian.md/download">Obsidian</a> for about two months, I&#39;ve
                        kinda written a haphazard collection of thoughts around how I gather information/take notes
                        since I struggle with note taking and never found appeal in saving quotes or thoughts from
                        books, or have a think piece about a book ... or rather my brain just straight up doesn’t work
                        like that. If someone asked me for a memorable quote, I couldn’t offer you that. I can offer
                        memorable moments and emotions in that moment—I think in experiences and emotions about general
                        things I suppose.

                        <p>
                            So what drove me to use Obsidian? Learning. I do not remember things I’ve learned, or rather
                            I do not retain them well. I can understand something perfectly and then blank out on how to
                            do it a week later, or even a few days later. So Obsidian felt perfect to make learning
                            notes and to link them together.
                        </p>

                            Hell, I&#39;ve even made a whole wiki for myself for my Genshin game so I have access to
                            every character without needing to boot up the game, or check out what builds I had planned
                            for characters, and it&#39;s fun to see everything tie together between nations, elements,
                            materials used for weapons and characters, game roles, and so on.
                        </p>

                                alt="Pad See Ew Recipe" />
                            I&#39;ve begun storing recipes here too, though this one I&#39;m torn if I wanna do it on my
                            iPhone notes (which has a great built-in conversion for tablespoons/cups), or keep it here,
                            or do both. It&#39;s easier for me to format here, versus copy and pasting recipe stuff on
                            mobile (so in the end I might still do both).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don’t know what I’d call this … the concept of PKM, commonplacing, zettelkasten and all
                            that fly over my head to some degree; I want to give a name to what system I’m using (just
                            for the sake of knowing <em>What</em> it is), but I also just accept this is my place to
                            store snippets of information that tie together into their own bubbles (since I
                            <em>really</em> don’t think my random note on why leaves turn green during autumn will have
                            connections to my studies in Blender).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would maybe like to analyze articles more, but circling back to quotes … my brain just
                            doesn’t work well at unpacking things, or citing quotes, and it’s a barrier I don’t know how
                            to work with outside of bookmarking articles I genuinely found interesting and maybe one day
                            forcing myself to take notes on it and what I liked about them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regardless, aside from my unsureness in what my note taking system is and places I wish to
                            change how I handle, it’s been nice having a ‘hub’ of information that’s local, not locked
                            to something online like Notion. I do have the sync so I can type on the go (I take notes of
                            my day to transfer to my physical journal, and sometimes it happens on my walks), but
                            otherwise this is just for <em>me</em> (and my hard drive backups).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maybe I need to take sticky note thoughts as I read stuff but haha, I’m cursed with a brain
                            that Does in the Moment, it doesn’t Stop to Write. It’s why I forget because I get focused
                            on doing with my metaphorical—or literal—hands, not documenting it until I’m done and out of
                            that focused state (which sometimes is a minus because I will forget what I’ve done).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, to summarize, it&#39;s been nice to be able to write down things to revisit later,
                            and it helps for my own memory to write down things like mechanical steps to do things ... I
                            also like my shiny chart (all the yellow stuff is my Genshin Wiki, oops).

                        constantly check and upload stuff which is annoying (context is joining pillowfort bc of what's
                        happening on bluesky)

                        Thinking about it, I've never liked making 'myself' in things ... avatars, picrew makers, games,
                        I've never really been fond of doing it ... but perhaps it's because since I was online (2010
                        and on), I've almost always used my OCs as a representation of myself (because they tend to have
                        a lot of me that subconsciously bleeds in).
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            The only mild exception to this was my early devART days where I used doodles of 'me' as I
                            am to decorate my journals, or boxes, or even avatars ... though as time passed, that slowly
                            phased out to use Resu instead, and even more so when I moved off devART to Tumblr. It was
                            <a href="oc/resu/index.html">Resu</a>, then <a href="oc/hideki.html">Hideki</a>, and now
                            <a href="/oc/sylvie/index.html">Sylvie</a>. Even in games, I prefer to make Sylvie than even
                            consider making something to represent myself. That, or just something separate from me, but
                            perhaps with the colours I like.

                            Case in point, my Warframe drifter ... a guy, but lots of pinks and blanks and pastels
                            muddled in.

                        <p>
                            Palia is the closest I've gotten to someone looking like 'me', but even then, it's not my
                            hair colour (I did have red highlights at a point, but that was way back in high school).
                            ... which speaking of, I need to return to at some point now that they have animal handling
                            as a mechanic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I guess some part of me has been wanting some physical representation of myself ... or some
                            'mascot' that's not just my OCs, because my OCs stand on their own feet with their own
                            development, but I also use them to represent me. It's not gonna change anytime soon from me
                            using Sylvie everywhere (they are my comfort character and emotional support after all, and
                            Hideki lasted <em>7 years</em> as my comfort character), but I wanted some 'sona', some
                            design that is just ... a design, of stuff <em>I</em> like.

                            I had <a href="/oc/cotton/index.html">Cotton</a>, but they're just ouppy shaped, not
                            something that can interact with things, and I'm not changing its design because I've had it
                            for years.

                            Anyway, this is not a coherent blog post, it's just me rambling and musing on things, and in
                            a weird way I'm at least happy I did make some design of <em>something</em> that I like and
                            could see as a ... 'hey, it's not me, but it represents things I like'. I do hope she
                            sticks, she's cute. <a href="https://toyhou.se/35279705.fluffy">Her design</a> is simple
                            enough to draw, and get art made of (and that was on purpose).

                        <p>
                            Funny that I'm hella not a furry, but I just wouldn't find comfort in making something
                            that's human and a 'sona'.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        i long for the energy to partake in discord groups again, i miss being social but it's so hard
                        to keep up with conversations, and in-jokes, and what's happening. i want to be more active on
                        my art socials but i feel like i have so little to offer in terms of art, or posting
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        sometimes it sucks to be so slow with art due to low energy, and with conversations. i miss
                        being a lot more social like i was in the past, but i also have such little energy/desire for it
                        as well!!! and it sucks!!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        even on my personal tumblr blog i have spurts where i have basically nothing to say or
                        contribute, because my energy is poured elsewhere
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        anyway whine whine rant. also yandere fics for zhongli suck 🤮 this is a more light-hearted
                        gripe alongside that and just me being annoyed that x reader fic content NEVER fits anything for
                        sylvie. i gotta make all the dang food myself (or commission it)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        on a good note at least i began doing commissions again, and finished this cute cupcake for a
                        commissioner which i'll eventually upload to my art gallery

                        i began a sims 3 legacy challenge yesterday and I can definitely tell you it's been
                        <i>something</i> so far in the very first day; for once i'm glad my game crashed and wound me
                        back to the beginning because:

                                acrobat job she picked up because she was just sobbing the whole on and off day and was
                                to depressed to clean which also made her upset. Hit too close to home LOL. Also kept
                                going insane on a full moon which didn&rsquo;t let her sleep or do anything for that
                                day. Couldn&rsquo;t socialize well because of her shyness and it was an endless vicious
                                loop where it crashed when I hovered over the &lsquo;unclog&rsquo; option on the toilet.

                        final day of post-grad finished on the 15th, although we still have a showcase to do of our big
                        VR project ... to celebrate, i bought salmon today and this dino friend i kept eyeballing when i
                        went to our grocery store last time (and on discount!)

                        i also finally got back into making my brick breaker game (tl;dr my computer wipe nuked my old
                        project completely, which in a weird way was a blessing in disguise to begin from zero here and
                        do cleaner code). freecodecamp has a <i>really</i> good

                    <p>

                        but last semester wasn't one to have 6h classes unlike this one.
                    </p>

                        sighs, curse of the fixation jumping has hit me, and in this case it's migrating my giant Notion
                        database of Genshin characters to uh ... Obsidian. i always wanted to keep a database of all my
                        characters + their planned/existing builds cause I genuinely forget sometimes what i'm doing
                        (plus links to builds on sites like game8 cause i'm lazy). i did have it on notion but 1. it's
                        laggy 2. it feels locked to online
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        so ... here's the progress so far!! i've been learning a little more about the dataview plugin
                        to have little aesthetic cards to use, cause i do like <i>some</i> visual flair, even if i also
                        prefer simple over the busy-ness you get out of Notion

                        man i miss webkinz. i gotta try to play it again, though the fact it's turned to a subscription
                        based model puts me off to it to some degree ... and why is it not in browser mode anymore??? i
                        hate having to download apps for games that used to be fully browser based. (ok small aside it
                        sounds like they are trying to return classic to the browser)

                        november 16, 2007 ... god i feel old, this account has been around for 18 years now. my google
                        was my first webkinz and they're sitting displayed on my fandom shelf LOOL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i wonder if people play more of the classic webkinz, or more of the upgraded 3d one ... kinda
                        sucks none of my pets carry over to the new one, so i'm not terribly inclined to do much on it

                        what tiny stuff i could

                        godspeed to myself to get through 300+ art pieces to set them up and write alt text for them all

                    <p>
                        sorry i’m just ill over imagining hu tao watching zhongli while he’s with sylvie and the
                        tenderness in his look and the smile that’s a little wider and more unguarded compared to his
                        general composure
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘old friend’ he says, and it is true that the tenderness is born out of a friendship that
                        <i>is</i> old, but few of the others he’s looked at with such love and care does he reach out to
                        touch, to have a hand pressed against skin, fabric, to welcome it in return
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        obviously hu tao is not going to say anything on it outside of maybe allude to it but it’s just
                        funny how obvious he was to people who know him (and do not have the veneer of ‘is rex lapis’
                        covering it as well, though i don’t doubt even the adepti would notice something—but because of
                        his previous role, i don’t think many would sit and think on it too long out of respect)
                    </p>

                        The title probably isn't&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> the wording of it, but yesterday was the first
                        time I wrote in my physical journal after 6 months of not doing it; my last entry was
                        mid-December, but I sorely needed to dump my thoughts out somewhere more tangible. I do still
                        want to pick up physical journaling for the tactile feel of writing and truly having a
                        non-digital way to blurt out my thoughts or the mundane things of life, I do realize I also
                        already do journal in many different facets, which is probably why it also makes it harder to
                        feel the need to physically journal.

                        <p>
                            ... but I still want to do physical journaling to have something in my hands that I can look
                            back on; it was fun flipping through my journal and seeing what I wrote about 6 months ago,
                            plus I like decorating it with stickers. Though I think the urge to be uh ... what's the
                            word ... to have a pretty looking journal brought me as well to a weird barrier, as well as
                            feeling the need to do it daily and needing to write more than just a single line or two. As
                            fun as it is looking through how others do their own for inspiration, it's hard not to feel
                            a trickle of the&nbsp;<em>need</em>
                            to join in, and write that much, and have nice journals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, I'm going to force myself to at least write&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;a line, and no
                            more. A simple highlight of the day. If I need to write more, I will, if I don't ... I don't
                            and just leave it to the next day for another highlight. If I want to do stickers, I will,
                            but I&nbsp;<u>need</u>
                            to not make myself think it needs them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Journaling is&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> hard with ADHD, but it can definitely be done in a
                            lot of different forms; I've seen people who have digital diaries logged on their sites, or
                            /now pages documenting what's been happening, or status updates, and so on. There's
                            definitely catharsis and something about having a document of your life somewhere tangible,
                            either in HTML, or handwritten. Especially as someone with subpar memory, it helps to be
                            able to look back on a part of the past and know it happened, and what was going on then.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, this is me just rambling about my recognition of journaling in different forms and
                            the desire to try to pick up handwritten journaling again.

                        Not too sure where I wanna go with this, but I was mostly just thinking about how my main OC(s)
                        end up having a lot more overlaps with me than I sometimes realize, and I realize far too late
                        about it.
                    </p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            Mostly cause I realize ...
                            <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/sylvie">Sylvie</a> has a thought process where
                            they don't think that people will remember them. Obviously they are a god who
                            <em>has</em> been forgotten/left behind, so their train of thought isn't all too surprising,
                            especially when they will outlive even human companions that have a short hundred-year
                            lifespan to cram people and events and things. But I realized today that I ... also struggle
                            with conceptualizing that people think of me outside a bubble, if that makes sense. It's
                            weird to wrap my brain around the concept that I can be admired, or talked about outside of
                            conversations ... I guess kinda like ...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            God fuck it all cycles
                            <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/object-permanence-and-adhd.html">back to ADHD</a>
                            doesn't it LMFAO, I was gonna say it's like object permanence and the idea of being out of
                            sight, out of mind. If it's the case, it's probably why it's hard for me to imagine that I
                            remain in people's memories or that people admire me/things I've done, cause my own brain is
                            lost in its own world until I have visual reminders of someone/something (even though I also
                            have people I admire for what they've done, I dunno why my brain just has a blocker thinking
                            the other way around).
                        </p>
                        <p>... and I only realize this now fully in looking at my own OC.</p>
                        <p>
                            Obviously, there's more than just that, Sylvie emulates a lot of the energy I'd
                            <em>like</em> to have, though my pool of energy is very subpar 99% of the time. Also ENFP
                            (them) vs INFP (me), a love of trying out new things, of food, and ... y'know, getting the
                            ADHD beam after I began researching it for myself. Though ironically, unlike my suspected
                            inattentive ADHD, theirs is hyperactivity and moving at 100% almost all the time and being
                            unable to sit still.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="oc/hideki/index.html">Hideki</a> was the other main OC I had for 7 years before
                            Sylvie took that mantle, and because he had been with me for so long (literally through
                            high-school and my college years), he's absorbed a <em>lot</em> from me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although my other big OCs (<a href="oc/yadyra/index.html">Yadyra</a> and
                            <a href="oc/nameless/index.html">Nameless</a>) do not have that emotional tie-in to my heart
                            as coping mechanisms, and considering how much they are their own characters standing on
                            their own feet (also immensely non-human and <em>not</em> like my personality at all), parts
                            of me still slip in. Hell, food as a joy will always tend to remain in all my characters,
                            even if they don't need to eat, or they're more specific enjoyments (inside joke between a
                            friend and I is that Yadyra currently has a burrito obsession).

                        I dunno why it spooks me to write about it, I guess because there's some part of me that still
                        feels like I'm a black sheep, because I only have being ace to my name, and some part of me
                        worries about being seen as 'invading' due to still IDing as cis, and heteroromantic, or that my
                        aceness isn't valid because of it (and god knows I've also seen my share of aphobia, not towards
                        myself but in general from even within LGBTQ+ communities).

                            It's not that I haven't questioned how I personally feel about my own gender, cause

                            I've sat and thought about it and ruminated and revisited it over the years, and still
                            circle back that I'm ok with just IDing as a girl, even if in concept it's not really
                            integral to me/not something I'm deeply connected to; it's like a container full of one type
                            of goop (feminine) but it's an immensely muted colour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Funnily enough, I lived more gender euphoria through exploring
                            <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/sylvie">Sylvie's</a> gender identity
                            (considering in the years I've had them it's shifted from masc he/they, to fully agender
                            they/them&mdash;since he/him for them made me feel uncomfortable&mdash;to finding a wild joy
                            in they/she and how much I feel that it fits them&nbsp;<em>perfectly</em>),
                            <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/hideki">Hideki's</a> exploration of presenting
                            himself as more fem and that it makes him happy, and finding
                            <a href="https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cassgender">cassgender</a> cause it hit the nail on
                            the head how I feel about myself; although I am comfortable IDing as a girl, and it is my
                            identity I am also comfy with, I feel disconnected to being it/it's not a huge part of how I
                            see myself.

                            As for romantic interest ... I think I like guys by the process of elimination more than
                            anything (no attraction to girls, single IRL crush was a guy, I like fictional
                            men&mdash;though I do have some fictional women I like, ex. Acheron who I like more in awe
                            of cause I
                            <em>love</em> her as a character). Truthfully I also have very little interest in the
                            concept of dating, though I think the concept of more romantic interactions is cute (albeit
                            I think romance, if pursued, needs a basis of friendship and someone you'd trust to talk
                            about with stuff like you would with friends ... I don't see much of a difference between a
                            romantic relationship and a friendship, minus some additional aspects ... and I mean this in
                            the sense for myself, everyone views the two in their own personal ways).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although I feel muddied and bland with my own self, I love seeing other people, and the
                            characters people make, and what they are and what is comfortable to them. I love learning
                            about different identities and how one expresses themselves and how they best feel
                            comfortable in whom (or what) they are, I love seeing people's posts about their progress,
                            transitions, their thoughts and ideas and posts talking about themselves, of stories from
                            people who are in their old ages who have found new pieces of themselves or the openness to
                            be themselves after so long. And I hope everyone finds somewhere safe they can exist,
                            considering the state of the world today (and even before today too).

                            Not really a coherent blog post, it's more akin to a verbal and personal diary dump in
                            trying to sort out my thoughts (maybe I need to rename this section to blog/diary) ... and
                            who knows, maybe like that Tumblr post from earlier, I'll revisit this later down in my life
                            and see how I feel. Something in my chest feels a little lighter talking about it, putting
                            it into words that I know won't quite as easily disappear under the copious amounts of posts
                            on my own blog.

                        ... and my thoughts being,
                        <u>why are people so weird about someone being non-sharing</u>
                        when it comes to yumeshipping / OC x canon? It's not the first time I've seen posts around like
                        'I don't believe in non-sharing, media characters belong to everyone' like ... ??? Why are you
                        to dictate if ... it exists or doesn't? Does someone not wanting to see content of their
                        <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="fictional other">f/o</span> in a romantic light offend
                        you? Do you think non-sharing people will grip their pitchforks and yell at you that you like or
                        make ship content including their f/o?
                    </p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            This is more I suppose a personal gripe/vent blog post, but I've never understood the
                            general catch-all mentality some people have that non-sharing people are 'hogging' a
                            character, or that characters need to be shared. It's not one I often see, but the few times
                            I have seen it baffles me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is not counting those who have seen non-sharing people who <em>do</em> go out of their
                            way to harass others sharing their f/o's, or have ... weirdly aggressive
                            <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="do not interact">DNIs</span> (which I've seen as
                            well, like literally the level of 'do not interact with me if you even
                            <strong>simp</strong> for my very real boyfriends!!!'), but to lump most people which I know
                            generally tend to stick to their own lanes into a bubble of 'you are wrong for wanting to
                            keep this private' is. Weird as fuck to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I say this as a non-sharing person who does curate my space, literally block buttons exists,
                            filters exist, <em>not looking at blogs and sites exist</em>. Yes, I could say the same that
                            I can just opt to not look at the people who complain about 'non-sharing people', but it is
                            frustrating to me when people look at others sitting in their own corners, doing their own
                            thing, and think it's&nbsp;<strong>wrong</strong> for them to want to not see certain
                            content of something that is a comfort to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No, I don't want to see Zhongli ships. I am happy for those who make OCs that kiss him,
                            genuinely I do mean it cause he is a wonderful character, but I do not want to see it
                            because my ship has an emotional comfort for me. I rarely will ever block someone for it,
                            and if I can opt to filter tags, I will happily do so as well. But never will I go chase
                            down someone because they have an OC/selfship with him, or they like some ship with him. All
                            I ever ask, for those who do talk to me, is merely that if those topics come up, I will step
                            out of the convo until it is over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So again, it's why I'm always very confused why people treat non-sharers like we're hoarding
                            characters or gonna chew out people who like/have ships with that character. Most people
                            will just sit in their corners and do what makes them happy; it's the same energy as
                            pointing to someone just standing in a corner and being like 'this person offends me'. God
                            forbid people set up their own boundaries for their comfort and people get offended for it.

                            (The DNI thing will bring me to another tangent I also think about a lot, but TL;DR
                            <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/peachdoxie/763010439828340736">this tumblr post</a>
                            summarizes it very well as to how I feel about DNIs in this day and age on
                            sites/rentries/carrds.)
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Ah, I think I figured out why I dislike DNIs conceptually so much: they're attempts to set
                            boundaries but are actually the complete opposite of how boundaries are supposed to work. A
                            boundary is not a demand you make of someone else (which is what a DNI is) but instead an
                            action you take against someone else's behavior. In this case, setting a boundary would be
                            blocking people who violate the DNI criteria, not making a statement about how they
                            shouldn't follow you. Making a DNI is requesting a courtesy from other people, but it is not
                            establishing a boundary.

                            Anyway, that's all to say I'm rambling on and just very sad when I see non-sharing people
                            like myself essentially get told that our comfort levels don't matter or exist or are
                            supported, that because we'd like to keep our ships to our heart and not see others ... that
                            we're 'bad' for doing so.

                        Sighs, game nostalgia ... though mine usually always swirls around the old MMOs I used to play.
                        Well, one isn&#39;t even all that old, considering I only quit it just 1&ndash;2 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love <a href="https://elsword.koggames.com">Elsword</a> still as a game, but I miss the old
                        era of it, when the level cap wasn&#39;t 99, it was 60, when the newest character was my future
                        main LuCiel, when the graphics and UI were chunky and dungeons took 10 minutes to clear vs the 2
                        minutes they take now. And it sucks because the private servers I&#39;ve found rarely ever
                        capture the essence of that time in the 2012-2015 era (minus one I just <i>literally</i> found
                        that&#39;s <a href="https://www.classicels.com/">barely getting its legs as of April 25th</a>)
                        because most move to the modern game, which I dislike.

                        <p>
                            There&#39;s a tinge of nostalgia that lingers for that era of 2013 Elsword, and for the time
                            I used to play <a href="https://www.playpwi.com/en">Perfect World International</a> too, one
                            which has so many private servers that it&#39;s not hard to find one covering the classic
                            era I played it in (also in the 2010-2013 range), but unlike Elsword ... trying to play it
                            ends up with me just dropping it a couple of days later. Some servers allow you to boost to
                            level cap, but I don&#39;t see the joy in that when I never got to level cap and experienced
                            endgame; to me, I liked the idea of leveling and going through dungeons on my own, but even
                            in private servers that have a boost in EXP, it still unfortunately feels tedious and clunky
                            and awkward!!!

                            And it makes me sad, because Perfect World International has SUCH a gorgeous landscape,
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/H0YuBmN6nNM">beautiful music</a> I still enjoy tenderly to this
                            day, and allowed you to take a mount and fly across the entire map if you wanted to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s a nostalgia, but it&#39;s one that makes me sad to some degree because I wish I
                            could enjoy those games like I did when I was young, where I remember losing hours staying
                            up late to play and grind, with the guilds I used to be in ... and perhaps It&#39;s because
                            I don&#39;t have the people anymore that brought light to those games that makes it so much
                            harder to get back into them. I don&#39;t mind solo grinding, but a lot of my fun was in
                            partaking in guild PVP fights and running dungeons and just talking with people while
                            playing dress-up with my cute fox-girl summoner (funnily enough my nostalgia here was from a
                            private server, I never got far in the official game and instead opted to play long-term in
                            a private server).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elsword I just straight up quit alongside my bestie, so that&#39;s less a case of
                            <i>community</i> and more a case that there aren&#39;t many private servers that cover the
                            era we both knew. Otherwise, the game as it is <b>sucks</b>, more in terms that raids and
                            continual enhancements have made the game a riddled, pay-to-win elitist mess, where if you
                            decided to main the &#39;wrong class&#39; people don&#39;t want you in the most recent raids
                            (case in point, my class was considered a sub-par DPS and only could work alongside a second
                            DPS instead of carrying a raid like other more <i>powerful</i> DPS classes, so I was shafted
                            a lot when it came to finding raid parties vs my friend who played a support that was always
                            in demand ... and since we were a duo pair, and we didn&#39;t go into separate parties, it
                            made progressing in the game stressful because of how people were about it).

                            I&#39;m glad FFXIV (even if on hiatus for me at the moment) fills a lot of that hole of an
                            MMO I can see myself dedicating time into ... and that I already have; although it cannot
                            replace the ache and longing for those games of the past, at least it can give me something
                            new to pour myself into.

                            Although it makes me sad to think about sometimes, I&#39;m glad there are places trying to
                            preserve the older times, even if the people that made those times good are gone now, it
                            doesn&#39;t hurt to live a little bit of nostalgia before shelving it again.

                            can't play it anymore like I used to because it's such a community centric game, and doing
                            stuff on your own is only so much fun)

                        On the topic of ADHD ... it&#39;s still something I&#39;m rolling around in my brain; it&#39;s
                        only been in the last 6&ndash;8 months that I&#39;ve really settled with the idea that I may
                        most likely have inattentive ADHD ... I don&#39;t have a way of getting assessed for it (not
                        until I move out anyway), but my head has been deep into videos and research and what not, and
                        helping a friend realize she also most likely has it (and her scoring high on an actual
                        assessment test) also settled it in my own brain.
                    </p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s kinda funny cause I&#39;ve had someone point out some posts I&#39;ve made (on
                            tumblr) align a lot with ADHD in the past, and I was there like &#39;haha it&#39;s a mood,
                            but I don&#39;t have it&#39; while also finding myself nodding and agreeing with other posts
                            people made about their ADHD/neurodivergent moods and experiences ... and while thinking
                            &#39;yeah, I feel that a lot, but I probably don&#39;t have it as bad as other people&#39;.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At least until I saw
                            <a href="https://sylviegirly.tumblr.com/post/765567124634763264">this post</a>
                            and something made it click in a way where I was like <i>&#39;oh&#39;</i>.
                        </p>
                        <img
                            class="full-width-image"
                            src="https://i.imgur.com/jJer7Fp.png"
                            alt="a tumblr screenshot, the first post writes: generally speaking when it comes to mental and physical health, if you're asked 'do you struggle with this' and your answer is 'no, Because I Have A System,' then your answer is actually yes" />
                        <p>
                            Because ... I&#39;ve had a lot of systems I put in place over the years. Reminders for my
                            &#39;subpar memory&#39; even for minor tasks like showering, setting tiny work amounts
                            (pomodoro), always relying on background noise, running timers for even small things like my
                            tea steeping, doing things on call with my friend, schedules, doing things half-way and at
                            least taking stride in that over nothing at all, subconscious fidgeting, putting things in
                            easy access and view, and probably other things I can&#39;t quite think of.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And it&#39;s funny because my long-term bestie of 8+ years now told me &#39;I always thought
                            you had it&#39; or something akin to basically having it like a red stamp on my forehead
                            LOOOL. On top of other people also pointing it out, and that the love and fixation I have
                            for Sylvie is definitely beyond the norm (for a normal, neurotypical person anyway).
                            Obviously growing on the internet, being fixated on your own OCs and fictional faves
                            wasn&#39;t unusual to me so it&#39;s why that didn&#39;t seem <i>weird</i> to me, and that
                            normal not-online people either way aren&#39;t weird about their own characters (if they
                            even make any) but yeah. Never really clicked.
                        </p>

                        <p>But it feels like an answer to a lot of things of how I am.</p>

                        <p>
                            My memory <i>is</i> terrible, yesterday blends into the past, and it&#39;s blurry. I
                            remember going to a cool food festival event with some coworkers and having the time of my
                            life ... but as soon as I get home/the next day, the event feels like it happened so long
                            ago, like years. Things don&#39;t feel real in particular, even though I know I was there,
                            there&#39;s some weird disconnect that I never really have been able to change. And I&#39;m
                            sad because many fun events I know I&#39;ve enjoyed myself at, I have no memories of if I
                            never noted them down in some form (pictures, writings), or if they were significant enough.
                            And even those blend: ex. we&#39;ve been to Cuba multiple times on vacation and I remember
                            general strokes and chunks like me finding a living starfish, but if you asked me which of
                            those trips it was, I could not tell you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I remembered a friend&#39;s birthday once because she shared it with my favourite fictional
                            character at the time, otherwise I need to write them down in my reminders to remember, even
                            if I love them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Time blindness is a <b>bitch</b>, and so is <b>task paralysis</b> (spinning random
                            wheels/coin flips are a nice solution for that).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am cursed to enjoy staring new projects and the hype and fixation rush (to be fair, this
                            site is one right now!!), but to not have the capability to carry most projects to their
                            completion without either working in a team, or having deadlines imposed on me with
                            consequences due to stress overwriting the ADHD part of the brain (I do not look at the
                            amount of projects I began around Sylvie, like a visual novel and RPG Maker game that are
                            half done).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My thoughts are jumbled and messy and jump in places, I can go from topic to topic without
                            finding it weird, I like using my own experiences to connect to situations. To be fair,
                            recognizing that it most likely is ADHD that is causing this has helped me view things in a
                            different light. Why I struggle to want to start something, why I like having an item here
                            but not there, what works for my focus and when my focus is absolutely shot (I usually try
                            to do 10&ndash;20 minutes of work even then, sometimes even just <i>starting</i> is enough
                            to get me to do a little more work than planned).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I tried to journal, but both physical and digital journals flopped for me (I know I do not
                            have to write in them every day, but if I don&#39;t try to keep consistency in some form, I
                            then forget to do the thing ... as soon as I slip, I usually stop doing it). Audio
                            journaling has been good to thought dump without feeling some looming pressure to write, or
                            want to decorate, and I don&#39;t feel the need to do it daily.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Aside from that, I usually rely on my phone reminders and timers to keep some semblance of
                            organization in my life, and I like organizing things in other facets of my life to scratch
                            an itch (like this site, my tumblr blog, my Notion, etc).
                        </p>

                        <p>But here are some of the tools I&#39;ve liked to use:</p>

                                and off, but I really like how it visualizes your free time + how your day is filled;
                                it&#39;s indie made as well

                                &mdash; my most recent addition, it's like having a second buddy with you, plus it has a
                                lot of lo-fi + background sounds included like brown noise and rainfall (which are my
                                go-to)

                                sadly only for iOS; I've fallen off from using it, but it was a nice tool for a while

                                it&#39;s honestly a pretty good interactive habit tracker/to-do for those who&#39;d like
                                a little RPG aspect to it

                            Not too sure what else to say outside of ... adult ADHD being hard to diagnose sucks!! I
                            think I know where mine came from if it is genetic (staring holes into my own dad), but
                            it&#39;s definitely not something like I feel like I can bring up with my own family.
                            Thankfully the online sphere is full of wonderful people, and information to see and get
                            from people who genuinely have it as well, so ... I am glad I&#39;ve learned a little more
                            about myself and understand myself a little better through it. Perhaps one day I can get a
                            full confirmation (hard not to have the lingering doubts about faking it eugh), but until
                            then I learn what works for me, and helps my brain a little more.

                    <p>
                        Hrrrr, well I guess it might be best to start the blogging page with err, <i>a blog</i>. It
                        might be a good way to also test out placing in images into actual article pages and see how
                        they function in the first place.
                    </p>

                            <b>And it works!!</b> Neat knowing block images can be centered with auto left/right
                            margins. Anyway, onto the actual blog post ... it&#39;s kinda hard cause when I do sit to
                            think about what I wanna write, I blank out; audio journalling has helped a lot on days I
                            need to thought dump (thanks <a href="https://www.untoldapp.com/">Untold</a> for that, very
                            sad it&#39;s iOS only) but it&#39;s rare that I <i>do</i> need to do it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So blog posts here will probably be very sporadic, but I will try to document things to the
                            best of my ability, might it be something I&#39;m working on or learning.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Right now, I&#39;m definitely in the trenches with the last 2 weeks of school, considering
                            assignments are heavily piled on right now. I&#39;m not terribly worried since I&#39;ve got
                            good grades in all of my classes, and my projects that are heavier work (Unity ones) I
                            managed to get an extension on. I hate to admit that Copilot is perfect for coding prototype
                            stuff
                            <b><u>really</u></b> fast, especially since my brain isn&#39;t a coder one (funny how I
                            decided to code a whole website then), and it&#39;s been easing up a lot of the stress
                            I&#39;ve had with this game project. Making curling into a VR game is ... <i>weird</i>, but
                            I&#39;ve got an idea, and it&#39;s slowly shaping into something more solid. Thankfully,
                            it&#39;s only a prototype, so I&#39;m not going super in-depth.
                        </p>

                            The other is just interactables, and it might take me more to make some shitty and quick
                            ProBuilder models to do a base colour on, vs just having physics based items you interact
                            with to simulate the tea-making industrial process (which surprisingly is still very
                            hands-on, this
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqDk2swTiB8">wonderful video</a> by Wu Mountain Tea
                            is what I&#39;m going to base it off, and probably do the oolong tea process in a more
                            simplified version.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Aside from that, working on this site has helped me to understand HTML/CSS better, though
                            Javascript is still a mystifying beast to me. Most likely because I know nothing about the
                            syntax they use for functions and things. Like I understand at a vague level (duh, I had C#
                            drilled into my brain for years in Game Design), but otherwise ... icky, <i>spooky</i>.
                            Still a lot to do, and I&#39;m very stumped on how I wanna handle OC profiles. It might be
                            the one instance where I do make a different CSS layout just for OCs and place them in a
                            folder to figure that out.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Otherwise, I do hope to get some work done on that because I wanna join the yume ring
                            that&#39;s here, but it requires a completed shrine. I guess if I think about it, shrines
                            are also ways to make new css/HTML layouts for something you like to dedicate to it. I do
                            really like ... yeah yeah, it is
                            <b>homogenizing</b>, but I do like consistency across the look of a website for anything
                            that isn&#39;t a special page. I have mad respect for the people who can make new layouts
                            for pages, cause I definitely could never (both in energy and my brain fighting against it).
                            Part of me wonders if I can just reuse my &lt;intro&gt; and &lt;aside&gt; sections and
                            modify them with my existing CSS, but also blehhhh. If there&#39;s a code that allows you to
                            &#39;merge&#39; columns (aka have one div that spans two of your defined columns) I might be
                            able to just use my old CSS, but some part of me also just wants to say fuck it and just
                            make an altered version only for OCs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I do have <a href="https://toyhou.se/">Toyhouse</a> for all of them, and I prefer that as my
                            OC hub for hosting everything + uploading all of my art and commissions, but I think
                            it&#39;d be so cool to make something a little more custom (I say as if my layout isn&#39;t
                            inspo&#39;d by the CSS layout I have on there, which speaking of I should credit in my
                            footer as inspo). I most likely will end up doing the same for my character layouts, or see
                            what other people have done on here, or see if any existing templates I can adjust/gut to
                            work with my current CSS ... anyway, plans and plans.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I should be playing the new HSR update, but I&#39;ve been <i>so</i> sucked into either
                            website work, or school work. Hell, even poor Minecraft got left behind which was my
                            fixation ... but that&#39;s it for now!! Till next time I get brainworms I need to offload.

                        sylvie and zhongli coming out of the bedroom, sylvie is marked with hickies (and hand marks) all
                        over their neck and chest that’s clearly seen, zhongli is absolutely plastered with lipstick
                        marks (and a very subtly angry bite just peeking out from under his collar)
                    </p>
