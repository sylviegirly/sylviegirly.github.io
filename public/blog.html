                    <p>
                        sorry i‚Äôm just ill over imagining hu tao watching zhongli while he‚Äôs with sylvie and the
                        tenderness in his look and the smile that‚Äôs a little wider and more unguarded compared to his
                        general composure
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‚Äòold friend‚Äô he says, and it is true that the tenderness is born out of a friendship that
                        <i>is</i> old, but few of the others he‚Äôs looked at with such love and care does he reach out to
                        touch, to have a hand pressed against skin, fabric, to welcome it in return
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        obviously hu tao is not going to say anything on it outside of maybe allude to it but it‚Äôs just
                        funny how obvious he was to people who know him (and do not have the veneer of ‚Äòis rex lapis‚Äô
                        covering it as well, though i don‚Äôt doubt even the adepti would notice something‚Äîbut because of
                        his previous role, i don‚Äôt think many would sit and think on it too long out of respect)
                    </p>

                    <h1>Journaling and Struggles</h1>
                    <p>
                        The title probably isn't&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> the wording of it, but yesterday was the first
                        time I wrote in my physical journal after 6 months of not doing it; my last entry was
                        mid-December, but I sorely needed to dump my thoughts out somewhere more tangible. I do still
                        want to pick up physical journaling for the tactile feel of writing and truly having a
                        non-digital way to blurt out my thoughts or the mundane things of life, I do realize I also
                        already do journal in many different facets, which is probably why it also makes it harder to
                        feel the need to physically journal.
                    </p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                        <summary>read more</summary>

                        <p>Cause I:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Write here on this blog to thought dump in a more cohesive manner</li>
                            <li>Use status.cafe to offload 'at the moment' thoughts so they don't sit in my skull</li>
                            <li>
                                Have my
                                <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/listfauxgraphy/">listography page</a> for
                                scattered ideas in one area
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Write on tumblr to also offload momentary thoughts in a more public/interactive place
                            </li>
                            <li>Talk to friends to offload thoughts</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            ... but I still want to do physical journaling to have something in my hands that I can look
                            back on; it was fun flipping through my journal and seeing what I wrote about 6 months ago,
                            plus I like decorating it with stickers. Though I think the urge to be uh ... what's the
                            word ... to have a pretty looking journal brought me as well to a weird barrier, as well as
                            feeling the need to do it daily and needing to write more than just a single line or two. As
                            fun as it is looking through how others do their own for inspiration, it's hard not to feel
                            a trickle of the&nbsp;<em>need</em>
                            to join in, and write that much, and have nice journals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, I'm going to force myself to at least write&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;a line, and no
                            more. A simple highlight of the day. If I need to write more, I will, if I don't ... I don't
                            and just leave it to the next day for another highlight. If I want to do stickers, I will,
                            but I&nbsp;<u>need</u>
                            to not make myself think it needs them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Journaling is&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> hard with ADHD, but it can definitely be done in a
                            lot of different forms; I've seen people who have digital diaries logged on their sites, or
                            /now pages documenting what's been happening, or status updates, and so on. There's
                            definitely catharsis and something about having a document of your life somewhere tangible,
                            either in HTML, or handwritten. Especially as someone with subpar memory, it helps to be
                            able to look back on a part of the past and know it happened, and what was going on then.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, this is me just rambling about my recognition of journaling in different forms and
                            the desire to try to pick up handwritten journaling again.
                        </p>

                    <h1>Blurb about my OCs and Me</h1>

                    <p>
                        Not too sure where I wanna go with this, but I was mostly just thinking about how my main OC(s)
                        end up having a lot more overlaps with me than I sometimes realize, and I realize far too late
                        about it.
                    </p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            Mostly cause I realize ...
                            <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/sylvie">Sylvie</a> has a thought process where
                            they don't think that people will remember them. Obviously they are a god who
                            <em>has</em> been forgotten/left behind, so their train of thought isn't all too surprising,
                            especially when they will outlive even human companions that have a short hundred-year
                            lifespan to cram people and events and things. But I realized today that I ... also struggle
                            with conceptualizing that people think of me outside a bubble, if that makes sense. It's
                            weird to wrap my brain around the concept that I can be admired, or talked about outside of
                            conversations ... I guess kinda like ...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            God fuck it all cycles
                            <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/object-permanence-and-adhd.html">back to ADHD</a>
                            doesn't it LMFAO, I was gonna say it's like object permanence and the idea of being out of
                            sight, out of mind. If it's the case, it's probably why it's hard for me to imagine that I
                            remain in people's memories or that people admire me/things I've done, cause my own brain is
                            lost in its own world until I have visual reminders of someone/something (even though I also
                            have people I admire for what they've done, I dunno why my brain just has a blocker thinking
                            the other way around).
                        </p>
                        <p>... and I only realize this now fully in looking at my own OC.</p>
                        <p>
                            Obviously, there's more than just that, Sylvie emulates a lot of the energy I'd
                            <em>like</em> to have, though my pool of energy is very subpar 99% of the time. Also ENFP
                            (them) vs INFP (me), a love of trying out new things, of food, and ... y'know, getting the
                            ADHD beam after I began researching it for myself. Though ironically, unlike my suspected
                            inattentive ADHD, theirs is hyperactivity and moving at 100% almost all the time and being
                            unable to sit still.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/hideki">Hideki</a> was the other main OC I had
                            for 7 years before Sylvie took that mantle, and because he had been with me for so long
                            (literally through high-school and my college years), he's absorbed a <em>lot</em> from me.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>INFP personality type</li>
                            <li>Gamers</li>
                            <li>Subpar confidence from back then and bad social anxiety</li>
                            <li>Overthinkers</li>
                            <li>Love language is cooking</li>
                            <li>Easily emotional and turning to crying to cope</li>
                            <li>Tries their best to be nice to everyone, surprised when it's returned</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I lived a lot through him in a way, in his successes and his sadness as an outlet.</p>
                        <p>... so yeah ... har har, boo boo the fool is I ...</p>
                        <p>
                            Although my other big OCs (<a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/yadyra">Yadyra</a>
                            and <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/nameless">Nameless</a>) do not have that
                            emotional tie-in to my heart as coping mechanisms, and considering how much they are their
                            own characters standing on their own feet (also immensely non-human and <em>not</em> like my
                            personality at all), parts of me still slip in. Hell, food as a joy will always tend to
                            remain in all my characters, even if they don't need to eat, or they're more specific
                            enjoyments (inside joke between a friend and I is that Yadyra currently has a burrito
                            obsession).
                        </p>

                    <h1>My Own Feelings on My Identity</h1>

                    <p>
                        I dunno why it spooks me to write about it, I guess because there's some part of me that still
                        feels like I'm a black sheep, because I only have being ace to my name, and some part of me
                        worries about being seen as 'invading' due to still IDing as cis, and heteroromantic, or that my
                        aceness isn't valid because of it (and god knows I've also seen my share of aphobia, not towards
                        myself but in general from even within LGBTQ+ communities).

                            It's not that I haven't questioned how I personally feel about my own gender, cause
                            unironically I've found

                            from way back in 2014 when I was ~16 years old talking about it.

                        <p>
                            I've sat and thought about it and ruminated and revisited it over the years, and still
                            circle back that I'm ok with just IDing as a girl, even if in concept it's not really
                            integral to me/not something I'm deeply connected to; it's like a container full of one type
                            of goop (feminine) but it's an immensely muted colour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Funnily enough, I lived more gender euphoria through exploring
                            <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/sylvie">Sylvie's</a> gender identity
                            (considering in the years I've had them it's shifted from masc he/they, to fully agender
                            they/them&mdash;since he/him for them made me feel uncomfortable&mdash;to finding a wild joy
                            in they/she and how much I feel that it fits them&nbsp;<em>perfectly</em>),
                            <a href="https://zhongvie.neocities.org/OCs/hideki">Hideki's</a> exploration of presenting
                            himself as more fem and that it makes him happy, and finding
                            <a href="https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cassgender">cassgender</a> cause it hit the nail on
                            the head how I feel about myself; although I am comfortable IDing as a girl, and it is my
                            identity I am also comfy with, I feel disconnected to being it/it's not a huge part of how I
                            see myself.

                                >(Might also kinda speak to why a lot of my OCs are agender, or don't see it as
                                important to their own identities.)</i

                            As for romantic interest ... I think I like guys by the process of elimination more than
                            anything (no attraction to girls, single IRL crush was a guy, I like fictional
                            men&mdash;though I do have some fictional women I like, ex. Acheron who I like more in awe
                            of cause I
                            <em>love</em> her as a character). Truthfully I also have very little interest in the
                            concept of dating, though I think the concept of more romantic interactions is cute (albeit
                            I think romance, if pursued, needs a basis of friendship and someone you'd trust to talk
                            about with stuff like you would with friends ... I don't see much of a difference between a
                            romantic relationship and a friendship, minus some additional aspects ... and I mean this in
                            the sense for myself, everyone views the two in their own personal ways).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although I feel muddied and bland with my own self, I love seeing other people, and the
                            characters people make, and what they are and what is comfortable to them. I love learning
                            about different identities and how one expresses themselves and how they best feel
                            comfortable in whom (or what) they are, I love seeing people's posts about their progress,
                            transitions, their thoughts and ideas and posts talking about themselves, of stories from
                            people who are in their old ages who have found new pieces of themselves or the openness to
                            be themselves after so long. And I hope everyone finds somewhere safe they can exist,
                            considering the state of the world today (and even before today too).
                        </p>

                            Not really a coherent blog post, it's more akin to a verbal and personal diary dump in
                            trying to sort out my thoughts (maybe I need to rename this section to blog/diary) ... and
                            who knows, maybe like that Tumblr post from earlier, I'll revisit this later down in my life
                            and see how I feel. Something in my chest feels a little lighter talking about it, putting
                            it into words that I know won't quite as easily disappear under the copious amounts of posts
                            on my own blog.

                    <h1>Non-Sharing Yumes + Thoughts</h1>

                    <p>
                        ... and my thoughts being,
                        <u>why are people so weird about someone being non-sharing</u>
                        when it comes to yumeshipping / OC x canon? It's not the first time I've seen posts around like
                        'I don't believe in non-sharing, media characters belong to everyone' like ... ??? Why are you
                        to dictate if ... it exists or doesn't? Does someone not wanting to see content of their
                        <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="fictional other">f/o</span> in a romantic light offend
                        you? Do you think non-sharing people will grip their pitchforks and yell at you that you like or
                        make ship content including their f/o?
                    </p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            This is more I suppose a personal gripe/vent blog post, but I've never understood the
                            general catch-all mentality some people have that non-sharing people are 'hogging' a
                            character, or that characters need to be shared. It's not one I often see, but the few times
                            I have seen it baffles me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is not counting those who have seen non-sharing people who <em>do</em> go out of their
                            way to harass others sharing their f/o's, or have ... weirdly aggressive
                            <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="do not interact">DNIs</span> (which I've seen as
                            well, like literally the level of 'do not interact with me if you even
                            <strong>simp</strong> for my very real boyfriends!!!'), but to lump most people which I know
                            generally tend to stick to their own lanes into a bubble of 'you are wrong for wanting to
                            keep this private' is. Weird as fuck to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I say this as a non-sharing person who does curate my space, literally block buttons exists,
                            filters exist, <em>not looking at blogs and sites exist</em>. Yes, I could say the same that
                            I can just opt to not look at the people who complain about 'non-sharing people', but it is
                            frustrating to me when people look at others sitting in their own corners, doing their own
                            thing, and think it's&nbsp;<strong>wrong</strong> for them to want to not see certain
                            content of something that is a comfort to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No, I don't want to see Zhongli ships. I am happy for those who make OCs that kiss him,
                            genuinely I do mean it cause he is a wonderful character, but I do not want to see it
                            because my ship has an emotional comfort for me. I rarely will ever block someone for it,
                            and if I can opt to filter tags, I will happily do so as well. But never will I go chase
                            down someone because they have an OC/selfship with him, or they like some ship with him. All
                            I ever ask, for those who do talk to me, is merely that if those topics come up, I will step
                            out of the convo until it is over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So again, it's why I'm always very confused why people treat non-sharers like we're hoarding
                            characters or gonna chew out people who like/have ships with that character. Most people
                            will just sit in their corners and do what makes them happy; it's the same energy as
                            pointing to someone just standing in a corner and being like 'this person offends me'. God
                            forbid people set up their own boundaries for their comfort and people get offended for it.
                        </p>

                            (The DNI thing will bring me to another tangent I also think about a lot, but TL;DR

                            summarizes it very well as to how I feel about DNIs in this day and age on
                            sites/rentries/carrds.)
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Ah, I think I figured out why I dislike DNIs conceptually so much: they're attempts to set
                            boundaries but are actually the complete opposite of how boundaries are supposed to work. A
                            boundary is not a demand you make of someone else (which is what a DNI is) but instead an
                            action you take against someone else's behavior. In this case, setting a boundary would be
                            blocking people who violate the DNI criteria, not making a statement about how they
                            shouldn't follow you. Making a DNI is requesting a courtesy from other people, but it is not
                            establishing a boundary.

                            Anyway, that's all to say I'm rambling on and just very sad when I see non-sharing people
                            like myself essentially get told that our comfort levels don't matter or exist or are
                            supported, that because we'd like to keep our ships to our heart and not see others ... that
                            we're 'bad' for doing so.

                    <h1>Nostalgia for MMOs</h1>

                    <p>
                        Sighs, game nostalgia ... though mine usually always swirls around the old MMOs I used to play.
                        Well, one isn&#39;t even all that old, considering I only quit it just 1&ndash;2 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love <a href="https://elsword.koggames.com">Elsword</a> still as a game, but I miss the old
                        era of it, when the level cap wasn&#39;t 99, it was 60, when the newest character was my future
                        main LuCiel, when the graphics and UI were chunky and dungeons took 10 minutes to clear vs the 2
                        minutes they take now. And it sucks because the private servers I&#39;ve found rarely ever
                        capture the essence of that time in the 2012-2015 era (minus one I just <i>literally</i> found
                        that&#39;s <a href="https://www.classicels.com/">barely getting its legs as of April 25th</a>)
                        because most move to the modern game, which I dislike.

                        <p>
                            There&#39;s a tinge of nostalgia that lingers for that era of 2013 Elsword, and for the time
                            I used to play <a href="https://www.playpwi.com/en">Perfect World International</a> too, one
                            which has so many private servers that it&#39;s not hard to find one covering the classic
                            era I played it in (also in the 2010-2013 range), but unlike Elsword ... trying to play it
                            ends up with me just dropping it a couple of days later. Some servers allow you to boost to
                            level cap, but I don&#39;t see the joy in that when I never got to level cap and experienced
                            endgame; to me, I liked the idea of leveling and going through dungeons on my own, but even
                            in private servers that have a boost in EXP, it still unfortunately feels tedious and clunky
                            and awkward!!!

                            day, and allowed you to take a mount and fly across the entire map if you wanted to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s a nostalgia, but it&#39;s one that makes me sad to some degree because I wish I
                            could enjoy those games like I did when I was young, where I remember losing hours staying
                            up late to play and grind, with the guilds I used to be in ... and perhaps It&#39;s because
                            I don&#39;t have the people anymore that brought light to those games that makes it so much
                            harder to get back into them. I don&#39;t mind solo grinding, but a lot of my fun was in
                            partaking in guild PVP fights and running dungeons and just talking with people while
                            playing dress-up with my cute fox-girl summoner (funnily enough my nostalgia here was from a
                            private server, I never got far in the official game and instead opted to play long-term in
                            a private server).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elsword I just straight up quit alongside my bestie, so that&#39;s less a case of
                            <i>community</i> and more a case that there aren&#39;t many private servers that cover the
                            era we both knew. Otherwise, the game as it is <b>sucks</b>, more in terms that raids and
                            continual enhancements have made the game a riddled, pay-to-win elitist mess, where if you
                            decided to main the &#39;wrong class&#39; people don&#39;t want you in the most recent raids
                            (case in point, my class was considered a sub-par DPS and only could work alongside a second
                            DPS instead of carrying a raid like other more <i>powerful</i> DPS classes, so I was shafted
                            a lot when it came to finding raid parties vs my friend who played a support that was always
                            in demand ... and since we were a duo pair, and we didn&#39;t go into separate parties, it
                            made progressing in the game stressful because of how people were about it).

                            I&#39;m glad FFXIV (even if on hiatus for me at the moment) fills a lot of that hole of an
                            MMO I can see myself dedicating time into ... and that I already have; although it cannot
                            replace the ache and longing for those games of the past, at least it can give me something
                            new to pour myself into.

                            Although it makes me sad to think about sometimes, I&#39;m glad there are places trying to
                            preserve the older times, even if the people that made those times good are gone now, it
                            doesn&#39;t hurt to live a little bit of nostalgia before shelving it again.

                            (I realize this is the same case with Club Penguin for me, a deeply nostalgic game, but I
                            can't play it anymore like I used to because it's such a community centric game, and doing
                            stuff on your own is only so much fun)

                    <h1>On ADHD and Myself + Tools</h1>

                    <p>
                        On the topic of ADHD ... it&#39;s still something I&#39;m rolling around in my brain; it&#39;s
                        only been in the last 6&ndash;8 months that I&#39;ve really settled with the idea that I may
                        most likely have inattentive ADHD ... I don&#39;t have a way of getting assessed for it (not
                        until I move out anyway), but my head has been deep into videos and research and what not, and
                        helping a friend realize she also most likely has it (and her scoring high on an actual
                        assessment test) also settled it in my own brain.
                    </p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            It&#39;s kinda funny cause I&#39;ve had someone point out some posts I&#39;ve made (on
                            tumblr) align a lot with ADHD in the past, and I was there like &#39;haha it&#39;s a mood,
                            but I don&#39;t have it&#39; while also finding myself nodding and agreeing with other posts
                            people made about their ADHD/neurodivergent moods and experiences ... and while thinking
                            &#39;yeah, I feel that a lot, but I probably don&#39;t have it as bad as other people&#39;.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At least until I saw
                            <a href="https://sylviegirly.tumblr.com/post/765567124634763264">this post</a>
                            and something made it click in a way where I was like <i>&#39;oh&#39;</i>.
                        </p>
                        <img
                            class="full-width-image"
                            src="https://i.imgur.com/jJer7Fp.png"
                            alt="a tumblr screenshot, the first post writes: generally speaking when it comes to mental and physical health, if you're asked 'do you struggle with this' and your answer is 'no, Because I Have A System,' then your answer is actually yes" />
                        <p>
                            Because ... I&#39;ve had a lot of systems I put in place over the years. Reminders for my
                            &#39;subpar memory&#39; even for minor tasks like showering, setting tiny work amounts
                            (pomodoro), always relying on background noise, running timers for even small things like my
                            tea steeping, doing things on call with my friend, schedules, doing things half-way and at
                            least taking stride in that over nothing at all, subconscious fidgeting, putting things in
                            easy access and view, and probably other things I can&#39;t quite think of.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And it&#39;s funny because my long-term bestie of 8+ years now told me &#39;I always thought
                            you had it&#39; or something akin to basically having it like a red stamp on my forehead
                            LOOOL. On top of other people also pointing it out, and that the love and fixation I have
                            for Sylvie is definitely beyond the norm (for a normal, neurotypical person anyway).
                            Obviously growing on the internet, being fixated on your own OCs and fictional faves
                            wasn&#39;t unusual to me so it&#39;s why that didn&#39;t seem <i>weird</i> to me, and that
                            normal not-online people either way aren&#39;t weird about their own characters (if they
                            even make any) but yeah. Never really clicked.
                        </p>

                        <p>But it feels like an answer to a lot of things of how I am.</p>

                        <p>
                            My memory <i>is</i> terrible, yesterday blends into the past, and it&#39;s blurry. I
                            remember going to a cool food festival event with some coworkers and having the time of my
                            life ... but as soon as I get home/the next day, the event feels like it happened so long
                            ago, like years. Things don&#39;t feel real in particular, even though I know I was there,
                            there&#39;s some weird disconnect that I never really have been able to change. And I&#39;m
                            sad because many fun events I know I&#39;ve enjoyed myself at, I have no memories of if I
                            never noted them down in some form (pictures, writings), or if they were significant enough.
                            And even those blend: ex. we&#39;ve been to Cuba multiple times on vacation and I remember
                            general strokes and chunks like me finding a living starfish, but if you asked me which of
                            those trips it was, I could not tell you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I remembered a friend&#39;s birthday once because she shared it with my favourite fictional
                            character at the time, otherwise I need to write them down in my reminders to remember, even
                            if I love them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Time blindness is a <b>bitch</b>, and so is <b>task paralysis</b> (spinning random
                            wheels/coin flips are a nice solution for that).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am cursed to enjoy staring new projects and the hype and fixation rush (to be fair, this
                            site is one right now!!), but to not have the capability to carry most projects to their
                            completion without either working in a team, or having deadlines imposed on me with
                            consequences due to stress overwriting the ADHD part of the brain (I do not look at the
                            amount of projects I began around Sylvie, like a visual novel and RPG Maker game that are
                            half done).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My thoughts are jumbled and messy and jump in places, I can go from topic to topic without
                            finding it weird, I like using my own experiences to connect to situations. To be fair,
                            recognizing that it most likely is ADHD that is causing this has helped me view things in a
                            different light. Why I struggle to want to start something, why I like having an item here
                            but not there, what works for my focus and when my focus is absolutely shot (I usually try
                            to do 10&ndash;20 minutes of work even then, sometimes even just <i>starting</i> is enough
                            to get me to do a little more work than planned).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I tried to journal, but both physical and digital journals flopped for me (I know I do not
                            have to write in them every day, but if I don&#39;t try to keep consistency in some form, I
                            then forget to do the thing ... as soon as I slip, I usually stop doing it). Audio
                            journaling has been good to thought dump without feeling some looming pressure to write, or
                            want to decorate, and I don&#39;t feel the need to do it daily.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Aside from that, I usually rely on my phone reminders and timers to keep some semblance of
                            organization in my life, and I like organizing things in other facets of my life to scratch
                            an itch (like this site, my tumblr blog, my Notion, etc).
                        </p>

                        <p>But here are some of the tools I&#39;ve liked to use:</p>

                                <a href="https://structured.app/">Structured</a> &mdash; a scheduling app, I use it on
                                and off, but I really like how it visualizes your free time + how your day is filled;
                                it&#39;s indie made as well
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.screenzen.co/">ScreenZen</a> &mdash; to avoid the time blindness
                                pitfall and to just help scrolling habits in general (or not getting lost in Cookie Run
                                games for 2&mdash;3 hours), also an indie app
                            </li>

                                sadly only for iOS
                            </li>

                                Habitica and already migrated my whole system to iOS&#39;s native Reminders, but
                                it&#39;s honestly a pretty good interactive habit tracker/to-do for those who&#39;d like
                                a little RPG aspect to it
                            </li>

                                for anything I need to focus on intensely and don&#39;t want voices for (since otherwise
                                I rely on YouTube videos), case in point with me writing this blog

                            Not too sure what else to say outside of ... adult ADHD being hard to diagnose sucks!! I
                            think I know where mine came from if it is genetic (staring holes into my own dad), but
                            it&#39;s definitely not something like I feel like I can bring up with my own family.
                            Thankfully the online sphere is full of wonderful people, and information to see and get
                            from people who genuinely have it as well, so ... I am glad I&#39;ve learned a little more
                            about myself and understand myself a little better through it. Perhaps one day I can get a
                            full confirmation (hard not to have the lingering doubts about faking it eugh), but until
                            then I learn what works for me, and helps my brain a little more.

                    <h1>Let's Start! I Suppose ...</h1>

                    <p>
                        Hrrrr, well I guess it might be best to start the blogging page with err, <i>a blog</i>. It
                        might be a good way to also test out placing in images into actual article pages and see how
                        they function in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <div class="center-img">
                        <a href="https://arunyi.art"

                        <summary>read more</summary>
                        <p>
                            <b>And it works!!</b> Neat knowing block images can be centered with auto left/right
                            margins. Anyway, onto the actual blog post ... it&#39;s kinda hard cause when I do sit to
                            think about what I wanna write, I blank out; audio journalling has helped a lot on days I
                            need to thought dump (thanks <a href="https://www.untoldapp.com/">Untold</a> for that, very
                            sad it&#39;s iOS only) but it&#39;s rare that I <i>do</i> need to do it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So blog posts here will probably be very sporadic, but I will try to document things to the
                            best of my ability, might it be something I&#39;m working on or learning.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Right now, I&#39;m definitely in the trenches with the last 2 weeks of school, considering
                            assignments are heavily piled on right now. I&#39;m not terribly worried since I&#39;ve got
                            good grades in all of my classes, and my projects that are heavier work (Unity ones) I
                            managed to get an extension on. I hate to admit that Copilot is perfect for coding prototype
                            stuff
                            <b><u>really</u></b> fast, especially since my brain isn&#39;t a coder one (funny how I
                            decided to code a whole website then), and it&#39;s been easing up a lot of the stress
                            I&#39;ve had with this game project. Making curling into a VR game is ... <i>weird</i>, but
                            I&#39;ve got an idea, and it&#39;s slowly shaping into something more solid. Thankfully,
                            it&#39;s only a prototype, so I&#39;m not going super in-depth.
                        </p>

                            The other is just interactables, and it might take me more to make some shitty and quick
                            ProBuilder models to do a base colour on, vs just having physics based items you interact
                            with to simulate the tea-making industrial process (which surprisingly is still very
                            hands-on, this
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqDk2swTiB8">wonderful video</a> by Wu Mountain Tea
                            is what I&#39;m going to base it off, and probably do the oolong tea process in a more
                            simplified version.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Aside from that, working on this site has helped me to understand HTML/CSS better, though
                            Javascript is still a mystifying beast to me. Most likely because I know nothing about the
                            syntax they use for functions and things. Like I understand at a vague level (duh, I had C#
                            drilled into my brain for years in Game Design), but otherwise ... icky, <i>spooky</i>.
                            Still a lot to do, and I&#39;m very stumped on how I wanna handle OC profiles. It might be
                            the one instance where I do make a different CSS layout just for OCs and place them in a
                            folder to figure that out.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Otherwise, I do hope to get some work done on that because I wanna join the yume ring
                            that&#39;s here, but it requires a completed shrine. I guess if I think about it, shrines
                            are also ways to make new css/HTML layouts for something you like to dedicate to it. I do
                            really like ... yeah yeah, it is
                            <b>homogenizing</b>, but I do like consistency across the look of a website for anything
                            that isn&#39;t a special page. I have mad respect for the people who can make new layouts
                            for pages, cause I definitely could never (both in energy and my brain fighting against it).
                            Part of me wonders if I can just reuse my &lt;intro&gt; and &lt;aside&gt; sections and
                            modify them with my existing CSS, but also blehhhh. If there&#39;s a code that allows you to
                            &#39;merge&#39; columns (aka have one div that spans two of your defined columns) I might be
                            able to just use my old CSS, but some part of me also just wants to say fuck it and just
                            make an altered version only for OCs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I do have <a href="https://toyhou.se/">Toyhouse</a> for all of them, and I prefer that as my
                            OC hub for hosting everything + uploading all of my art and commissions, but I think
                            it&#39;d be so cool to make something a little more custom (I say as if my layout isn&#39;t
                            inspo&#39;d by the CSS layout I have on there, which speaking of I should credit in my
                            footer as inspo). I most likely will end up doing the same for my character layouts, or see
                            what other people have done on here, or see if any existing templates I can adjust/gut to
                            work with my current CSS ... anyway, plans and plans.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I should be playing the new HSR update, but I&#39;ve been <i>so</i> sucked into either
                            website work, or school work. Hell, even poor Minecraft got left behind which was my
                            fixation ... but that&#39;s it for now!! Till next time I get brainworms I need to offload.
