    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        I'm not very good at remembering what I've done across a span of time, so I will try my best to
                        offer little updates of what's been going on in my life (maybe I'll even aim for a weekly or
                        biweekly update. Maybe I'll have a little archive later on of what's happened for my own sake.

                            Approaching the fourth week of the semester, and we finally settled on a group game we're
                            doing for a charity that's teaching kids about African history and culture, and we're going
                            to make a cooking simulator teaching 1-2 cultural relevant dishes; I'm really excited for
                            it!! I do worry about some of the classmates that aren't consistent with showing up, but
                            because we're a full group of 8, there's at least 5 of us who <b>are</b> consistent with
                            work

                            tomorrow or the next day, poor things grew so much that they're pushing against the
                            ultraviolet light but it's been far too cold to plant them

                            I've been making progress on my RPG Maker MZ game to help promo my friend's book, and

                            I've done, considering I have a lot of mini projects to do
                            <ul>
                                <li>Finishing leveling RDM + associated quests</li>

                            Still doing The Apothecary Diaries, did pick up one episode of
                            <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/59597/Witch_Watch">Witch Watch</a> which is pretty

                            and it's really drilled in how society really pushes for people to be overworked and
                            punishing them for listening to their own mental health and bodily health. A good read for
                            some tips to try to break out of society's toxicity of punishing 'laziness'

                                    Starting my new semester ... last semester too, which makes me mildly worried about
                                    all my courses and all the assignments that we need to do; I'm gonna try to stay on
                                    top of them this time

                                            It doesn't help that halfway through the course we're swapping three
                                            (three!) classes from online to in person ... we're probably gonna try to
                                            complain about it since many of the students here travel by transport and
                                            don't live in the city
