    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        I'm not very good at remembering what I've done across a span of time, so I will try my best to
                        offer little updates of what's been going on in my life (maybe I'll even aim for a weekly or
                        biweekly updates). Maybe I'll have a little archive later on of what's happened for my own sake.
                        Inspired off

                            Ughhh ughh ugh school assignment stuff UGH (I just have gotten rusty with doing assignments
                            so it's always like something looming over my skull); we have been learning cool coding
                            things though

                        <li>
                            Picked up journaling again, or I'm trying to anyway by keeping it simple and doing a single
                            highlight a day at the bare basic, and writing more only if I need to. Honestly it's been
                            nice, especially since I have a lot of stickers and enjoy decorating the pages, though I'm
                            trying my best to not get overwhelmed

                                    I found out all along I had a double sided tape roll from college that I completely
                                    forgot about ... I've been trying to use glue sticks üóø

                        <li>
                            Picked up using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to <i>try</i> to keep notes of
                            stuff I'm learning, especially for things like Unreal or Blender, or when I decide to learn
                            Blockbench modelling. It's hard because I tend to watch/do rather than take notes of the
                            process, which can bite me in the ass. Heavily inspired from
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRBXGOr6faU">JayTheDevGuy's video</a> on it

                            Mostly just been focused on helping my friend with her author livelihood and book editing

                        <li>
                            Site wise, it's mostly just been back-end stuff cause right now that's more appealing to me
                            than making new content. Creating my media log though has been really cool

                            I'm trying to carry my 3DS around more with me to have as something to do that's

                                    Approaching the fourth week of the semester, and we finally settled on a group game
                                    we're doing for a charity that's teaching kids about African history and culture,
                                    and we're going to make a cooking simulator teaching 1-2 cultural relevant dishes;
                                    I'm really excited for it!! I do worry about some of the classmates that aren't
                                    consistent with showing up, but because we're a full group of 8, there's at least 5
                                    of us who <b>are</b> consistent with work

                                    I finally took the plunge to upload my old project
                                    <a href="https://asuraid.itch.io/electrobit">Electrobit</a> fully on itch.io; the
                                    version that was up was an <u>old</u> alpha version, but since the game has been off
                                    the App Store for at least a few years now, I decided to add <b>my</b> finalized
                                    version (which was different than what was uploaded)
                                </li>

                                    and it's really drilled in how society really pushes for people to be overworked and
                                    punishing them for listening to their own mental health and bodily health. A good

                                    Starting my new semester ... last semester too, which makes me mildly worried about
                                    all my courses and all the assignments that we need to do; I'm gonna try to stay on
                                    top of them this time
                                    <ul>

                                            It doesn't help that halfway through the course we're swapping three
                                            (three!) classes from online to in person ... we're probably gonna try to
                                            complain about it since many of the students here travel by transport and
                                            don't live in the city

                                    With summer being here ... ish ... I've been going out on more walks and playing
                                    more Pok&eacute;mon Go, which is nice

                                    The seeds my grandma put in the nursery we borrowed have been growing super well,
                                    though I had to rip one root that was reaching out to the other seeds
