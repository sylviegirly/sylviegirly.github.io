    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        I'm not very good at remembering what I've done across a span of time, so I will try my best to
                        offer little updates of what's been going on in my life (maybe I'll even aim for a weekly or
                        biweekly updates). Maybe I'll have a little archive later on of what's happened for my own sake.

                        <li>
                            Blargh, back to school. Nothing of major note has been happening outside of project work and
                            annoyance with my career class that I do <i>not</i> need as someone who's done resume and
                            job applications before
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I ... think I'm basically in on the one VR development opportunity I got offered, though he
                            did mention if work was to come, it'd be more in the fall
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I've kinda gotten a hang of using Obsidian now to take down learning notes + daily
                            offloading of 'in the moment' thoughts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Progressing further with doing the little mini RPG Maker game for my friend's book promo
                        </li>
                        <li>Mostly site work, made Sylvie's genshin game kit + made an art gallery</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Games</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Deltarune chapter 2 is being worked through slowly</li>
                        <li>
                            Pulled Phainon for HSR a few days ago (in like 30 whole pulls??? and without guarantee???)
                            so I've been building him slowly
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    In terms of Genshin Impact, mostly been working on Skirk and getting her to 90, as
                                    well as trying to get better artifacts for her
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally got a chance to make a new Spore account, though it was like pulling teeth since I
                            had to re-buy Galactic Adventures ... <b>again</b> ... I own these games 3 times over now
                            ... fucking hate EA Games
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Started playing Imperishable Night (Touhou) again since it's what I grew up on during high
                            school, though I'm so out of practice ... annoying when easy is <i>too</i> easy but the
                            normal is too hard
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Started a Rags to Riches challenge in Sims 4 using my Sylvie and Zhongli sims, though I
                            think I hit my burnout now that I'm at the point of a stable house + needing to wait to save
                            money

                                    On the cusp of ending my school break ... the day before I went to a mixer for my
                                    school, although I was invited as a guest (since it's a program for people wanting
                                    to
                                    <i>start</i> freelancing or start-up companies), I got to meet some really cool
                                    people there including a fellow Genshin-er
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Almost been doing journaling for a month straight!! Surprisingly the 'note a single
                                    highlight of the day' has been working really well for me; I can just leave it at
                                    that, or expand on it if I want to with no pressure. Sometimes I miss weekends
                                    because there's no comfortable time to write alone, but that's ok
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Began trying to learn <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> following
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0">Brackey's</a>
                                    tutorial, though I'm only like 20 minutes in because I'm trying to note things down
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I may ... ? Have found some job opportunity ... ? Or well, my teacher recommended me
                                    to someone, although it's for programming, it's in Unity which I'm very familiar
                                    with. I'm not too sure of the details, but I already signed an NDA and got sent the
                                    software to work with so ... ? It's only freelancing/contract work for now and
                                    gathering a pool of talent, but who is to know about the future ...

                                            It's a little scary because I've never considered offering myself for any
                                            developer/programming jobs; I know how to code in C#, but I'd never consider
                                            myself confident enough to say I <u>know</u> it enough for a job ... even
                                            though y'know, I <i>have</i> coded games in it
                                        </li>

                                    I think I'm getting a hang of using Obsidian, though mine is very boringly for just
                                    noting down my learning in programs like Godot for stuff
                                </li>

                                    Finally finished with Undertale, and slowly going through Deltarune (I'm streaming

                                    Ughhh ughh ugh school assignment stuff UGH (I just have gotten rusty with doing
                                    assignments so it's always like something looming over my skull); we have been
                                    learning cool coding things though

                                    Picked up journaling again, or I'm trying to anyway by keeping it simple and doing a
                                    single highlight a day at the bare basic, and writing more only if I need to.
                                    Honestly it's been nice, especially since I have a lot of stickers and enjoy
                                    decorating the pages, though I'm trying my best to not get overwhelmed

                                            I found out all along I had a double sided tape roll from college that I
                                            completely forgot about ... I've been trying to use glue sticks 🗿

                                    Picked up using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to <i>try</i> to keep
                                    notes of stuff I'm learning, especially for things like Unreal or Blender, or when I
                                    decide to learn Blockbench modelling. It's hard because I tend to watch/do rather
                                    than take notes of the process, which can bite me in the ass. Heavily inspired from

                                    Site wise, it's mostly just been back-end stuff cause right now that's more
                                    appealing to me than making new content. Creating my media log though has been

                                    Approaching the fourth week of the semester, and we finally settled on a group game
                                    we're doing for a charity that's teaching kids about African history and culture,
                                    and we're going to make a cooking simulator teaching 1-2 cultural relevant dishes;
                                    I'm really excited for it!! I do worry about some of the classmates that aren't
                                    consistent with showing up, but because we're a full group of 8, there's at least 5
                                    of us who <b>are</b> consistent with work

                                    the App Store for at least a few years now, I decided to add <b>my</b> finalized
                                    version (which was different than what was uploaded)
