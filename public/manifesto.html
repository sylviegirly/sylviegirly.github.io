    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        This page serves more as a summary of how and why this website came to be, and just my general
                        feelings as of right now with the state of the online world.
                        <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/manifesto/">Bechno Kid</a>&#39;s and
                        <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/about/manifesto">Petra</a>&#39;s manifestos were
                        inspirations to write my own, and it&#39;ll probably grow and shape itself over time as I refine
                        my thoughts.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="history-online">History Online</h2>
                    <img
                        class="image hide-mobile"
                        src="img/decos/clubpenguin.gif"
                        style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0; border-radius: var(--border-radius)"

                    <p>
                        My history with online has always been ... very entrenched in community? I lived in places like
                        Club Penguin and DeviantART and made some wonderful connections over the years (a few people
                        which I managed to reconnect with from my old 2012 days on DA; I was deep into the OC/Canon
                        Bleach community back then).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was never much of a web surfer ... <em>ish</em>, most of my socialization was on DevART, Club
                        Penguin, online games like Perfect World Online and Elsword, the early days of MSN and Skype
                        (mostly with gaming friends), and kid site games (Webkinz, Jetix TV games, Barbie sites) cause I
                        had a lot of fun on those and didn&#39;t feel the urge to dive around deeper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Definitely came across stuff that I sure as hell shouldn&#39;t have at my age, Encyclopedia
                        Dramatica you sure were something ... not the kinda thing you should read during high school
                        lunch breaks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As such, nostalgia doesn&#39;t drive me due to my history, and I&#39;m not seeking it since I
                        never grew up on stuff like Geocities when my time was spent in Webkinz and Club Penguin. I just
                        miss customization that most places have stripped away (DeviantART and its stupid overhaul due
                        to Wordpress buying it, Tumblr now redirecting to mobile views instead of themes, the
                        enshittification of UI to all look the damn same everywhere unless you install extensions to
                        change it).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (I still sometimes log into my old Webkinz account and have tried out Club Penguin private
                        servers, but it doesn&#39;t hit like it used to.)
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
                    <aside>
                        (Kinda glad most of my mutuals on my social medias like Tumblr are sane people, so I rarely ever
                        come across stupid shit, and usually if I do, it&#39;s dogshit takes that everyone is looking at
                        like &#39;why would you type that&#39;.)
                    </aside>
                    <p>
                        These days, I&#39;m not active much on socmed, mostly because I&#39;m tired 95% of the time and
                        have very little energy to spare. Tumblr was my first real social media I joined back in 2012,
                        and I&#39;m still on my original blog since then; my blog has always felt like a little website
                        in itself, considering themes really allowed me to explore my creativity across my personal blog
                        and my roleplay blogs, and it&#39;s why I&#39;ve stuck around so long (considering I also
                        roleplayed there).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I doubt I will ever drop social media altogether, since I find joy in being able to see what my
                        mutuals and friends are interacting with and reblogging and talking about, even the most mundane
                        of things. I also have art accounts to upkeep on occasion, as much as it&#39;s hard for me to
                        do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I met my best friends on here, one whom I met IRL, and many others I hope to meet in person one
                        day because they&#39;ve been by my side for years now. I can&#39;t discard that it&#39;s helped
                        me keep friendships and human connection and not feeling all that alone (I wish I could teleport
                        to visit people).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even so, it&#39;d be hard to say there hasn&#39;t been some shift in how volatile people can be,
                        and it&#39;s why I dropped Twitter completely; having to see absolutely dogshit takes 24/7 is
                        exhausting. I&#39;m not saying Tumblr is free from it either, but as a veteran of the site, it
                        feels more like watching the occasional clown car explosion before you just move on with your
                        life.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="indie-web">Indie Web</h2>
                    <p>
                        I&#39;ve heard of Neocities from a tumblr roleplay mutual
                        <a href="https://calamari.isnotanoctopus.art/">who made his own</a> a year or two ago, which I
                        thought was really cool as well, but never pursued it further—the idea of making a website was
                        cool ... but the coding wasn&#39;t.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At that time I also got into making carrds, and still do have my own
                        <a href="https://aid.uwu.ai/">personal one</a> (and the many templates I&#39;ve made for the
                        Tumblr <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="roleplaying community">RPC</span>); I love Carrd
                        for its flexibility and ease of access to all people alike without any coding required, but ...
                        it doesn&#39;t hit like a Tumblr theme does. You have no idea how annoyed I was seeing that
                        in-line images aren&#39;t a thing!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My tumblr theme is as close to a website as I had then, but even so a lot of my links went out
                        to other sites (Bluesky, Carrd, Toyhouse), and there&#39;s no true, centralized info hub ...
                        that&#39;s me. I think the push that finally made me consider it was people talking about
                        another wave of staff layoffs at Tumblr (god knows it&#39;s a cyclical thing at this rate for
                        Tumblr to go through its annual &#39;it might die&#39; phase), and having exported out my blog
                        ... some part of me finally caved to looking back into Neocities, and making this site on the
                        same day too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Community will always keep me engaged, but I wanted to find more personalized corners that are
                        me as well, and a creative outlet amidst the art burnout I have been in since 2024.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, here I am now. I doubt this site will fully replace some places (there&#39;s no way in hell
                        I&#39;m transferring my entire Toyhouse over considering that&#39;s a culmination of years of my
                        own artwork and commissions in images, and there&#39;s only so much JPEG and WEBP crunching that
                        can make up for a 1GB space limit), but it&#39;ll be the most complete place that showcases my
                        interests and random tidbits of my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And honestly I like the slowness of everything, even though I still find myself eagerly
                        scrolling through and peeping around what my neighbours are doing when there are new updates to
                        their sites ... there&#39;s something cozier about it. I like looking through what other people
                        did with their websites! I love seeing people expressing themselves!
                    </p>
                    <p>And it&#39;s a nice break from social media to focus my efforts somewhere else.</p>
                    <h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
                    <p>
                        It&#39;s been a happy journey so far, and I&#39;m a person that thrives in finding problems to
                        solve in code—even if frustrating, it itches some part of my brain in having something to chew
                        on and hammer at and look forward to working on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pages like my diary, blog, media log, are made for me to trim and grow over time, so I will
                        always have something to revisit, even when my OC pages or art gallery is done; this will be a
                        living site that always can have a new bud growing in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a bunch of disjointed thoughts to summarize that this site is a little collection of
                        what makes me who I am, and a collection of what I enjoy. I&#39;m glad to have a little corner
                        of respite away from everything else, and I hope that if you got to the end of this, that you
                        enjoy your time here (even if it is just me babbling about random stuff or recipes I like or my
                        OCs).
