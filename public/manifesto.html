    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        Manifesto
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        This page serves more as a summary of how and why this website came to be, and just my general
                        feelings as of right now with the state of the online world.
                        <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/manifesto/">Bechno Kid&#39;s</a> and
                        <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/about/manifesto">Petra&#39;s</a> manifestos were
                        inspirations to write my own, and it&#39;ll probably grow and shape itself over time as I refine
                        my thoughts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My history with online has always been ... very entrenched in community? I lived in places like
                        Club Penguin and DeviantART and made some wonderful connections over the years (a few people
                        which I managed to reconnect with from my old 2012 days on DA; I was deep into the OC/Canon
                        Bleach community back then). I thrived in places like that, loved playing on various doll site
                        games and the Barbie flash games and all of that, Webkinz, Jetix TV flash games, etc<i>.</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I still thrive on Tumblr, which has been my hellhole (affectionate) since 2012 and still going
                        strong on my original blog since then; my blog has always felt like a little website in itself,
                        considering themes really allowed me to explore my creativity across my personal blog and my
                        roleplay blogs. Truthfully, Tumblr is really the last bastion of a social media that I&#39;m
                        truly active on anyway, like many others I&#39;ve also grown tired with the state of social
                        media, in both the form of a lack of personalization, and that it feels a lot more hostile
                        overall (corporate greed etc. blah blah).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I doubt I will ever drop social media altogether, since I find joy in being able to see what my
                        mutuals and friends are interacting with and reblogging and talking about, even the most mundane
                        of things ... but I&#39;m naturally a very low energy person, so it&#39;s a flux between wanting
                        to engage and keep up with everything, and <i>drowning</i><i> </i>and burning out of energy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Community will always keep me engaged, but I wanted to find more personalized corners that are
                        <i>me</i>.
                    </p>

                    <aside>
                        <p>
                            On an aside, I do love <a href="https://sheezy.art">Sheezy Art</a> a lot for bringing back a
                            lot of what DeviantART was to me (allowing personalization of your profiles), though it
                            sucks I don&#39;t quite have the spoons to keep up with posting even there and following the
                            community. I definitely do recommend it for artists who&#39;d like a more personal
                            portfolio, and a smaller community.
                        </p>
                    </aside>

                    <p>
                        I&#39;ve heard of Neocities from a tumblr roleplay mutual
                        <a href="https://calamari.isnotanoctopus.art/">who made his own</a> a year or two ago, which I
                        thought was really cool as well, but never pursued it further&mdash;the idea of making a website
                        was cool ... but the coding wasn&#39;t. At that time I also got into making carrds, and still do
                        have <a href="https://aid.uwu.ai/">my own personal one</a> (and the many templates I&#39;ve made
                        for the Tumblr
                        <span class="tippy" data-tippy-content="roleplaying community">RPC</span>);&nbsp;I love Carrd
                        for its flexibility and ease of access to all people alike without any coding required, but ...
                        it doesn&#39;t hit like a Tumblr theme does. You have no idea how annoyed I was seeing that
                        in-line images aren&#39;t a thing!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My tumblr theme is as close to a website as I had then, but even so a lot of my links went out
                        to other sites (Bluesky, Carrd, Toyhouse), and there&#39;s no true, centralized info hub ...
                        that&#39;s <i>me</i>. I think the push that finally made me consider it was people talking about
                        another wave of staff layoffs at Tumblr (god knows it&#39;s a cyclical thing at this rate for
                        Tumblr to go through its annual &#39;it might die&#39; phase), and having exported out my blog
                        ... some part of me finally caved to looking back into Neocities, and making this site on the
                        same day too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, here I am now. I doubt this site will fully replace some places (there&#39;s no way in hell
                        I&#39;m transferring my entire Toyhouse over considering that&#39;s a culmination of years of my
                        own artwork and commissions in images, and there&#39;s only so much JPEG crunching that can make
                        up for a 1GB space limit), but it&#39;ll be the most complete place that showcases my interests.
                        And honestly I like the slowness of everything, even though I still find myself eagerly
                        scrolling through and peeping around what my neighbours are doing when there are new updates to
                        their sites ... there&#39;s something cozier about it. I like looking through what other people
                        did with their websites! I love seeing people expressing themselves!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It&#39;s been a happy journey so far, and I&#39;m a person that thrives in finding problems to
                        solve in code&mdash;even if frustrating, it itches some part of my brain in having something to
                        chew on and hammer at and look forward to working on, even if I&#39;ll be sad when most of my
                        site is <i>done</i> and only needs patching or updating here and there. Even so, I built this
                        with my own two hands and a lot of help from other wonderful people listed in my credits, and
                        this will be a living site that always can have a new bud growing in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is a bunch of disjointed thoughts to summarize that this site is a little collection of
                        what makes me who I am, and a collection of what I enjoy. I&#39;m glad to have a little corner
                        of respite away from everything else, and I hope that if you got to the end of this, that you
                        enjoy your time here (even if it is just me babbling about random stuff or recipes I like or my
                        OCs).

                    <p>This is more for accessibility and what the site will strive for:</p>

                        <li>
                            This site will do its best to be mobile responsive; elements that do not translate well onto
                            mobile will be hidden
                        </li>
                        <li>Keyboard navigatiable nav bar + jump to content link</li>
                        <li>Semantic HTML</li>
                        <li>
                            GIFs will be kept minimal or near the bottom of pages / out of main content; if prominent,
                            either a freeze frame will be implemented, or a warning
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Contrasting colours that pass the 4.5 limit
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Only exception is items like my status.cafe widget which I can't add a dark/light
                                    toggle to ü•≤
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>EM scaling text sizes instead of PX</li>
                        <li>Font toggle between default text and a more legibile text like Atkinson Hyperlegible</li>
                        <li>Alt text for all non-decorative images, and aria-hidden for all decorative ones</li>
                        <li>
                            Dark and light mode with a toggle, but otherwise respecting user's default system choice
                        </li>
                        <li>No autoplay</li>
                        <li>
                            Although I have an accessibility widget, it is <u>not</u> a replacement for accessibility
                            functions
                            <ul>

                                    I mostly like it for the monochrome function + having Open Dyslexia as a font built
                                    in; with my toggle only being between two fonts, I think this works alright.
                                    Unfortunately does not persist between pages
