                        I&#39;ve seen these around, and I&#39;m not sure exactly still <i>what</i> to write, but I
                        really liked <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/manifesto/">Bechno Kid&#39;s</a> and
                        <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/">Petra&#39;s</a> manifesto a lot and wanted to write
                        something up in spirit ... I&#39;ll probably hammer it out over time and add more, but I&#39;ve
                        always been a person whose pro &quot;make your own space with all ur &#39;cringy&#39;
                        loves&quot;.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        God knows I had too many stamps and decos and everything on my DeviantArt back then. I do have
                        my own <a href="http://aid.uwu.ai/"> personal carrd</a> still, and I <b>love</b> carrd for its
                        flexibility and ease of access to all people alike (especially since I&#39;ve made templates for
                        it!!), but ... it doesn&#39;t hit like a custom website does.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That, and it doesn&#39;t really help that Tumblr goes through a potential shutting down crisis
                        almost every year now. I&#39;d really be depressed to lose that site, considering the
                        customization of it (the only last site I know that lets you make themes + where I learned all
                        of my CSS/HTML from), and the fact I&#39;ve been on it for 13 years of my life (2012
                        Mishapocalypse babeyyyy). So I guess this site is in a way a love letter to Tumblr as well
                        because it&#39;s what has <b>taught</b> me CSS/HTML, or how to pluck it apart and to work with
                        it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Um, so this site will probably just be a collection of my favourite things, my OCs, and just
                        what makes me ... <i>me</i>. I&#39;m not very good at aggregating things about myself, but
                        I&#39;d like to have this as a website that&#39;s just for myself and for people to see who I
                        am. I most likely won&#39;t be posting my artwork since I already have dedicated sites for that
                        (and all of my commissions are hosted through VGen), so it&#39;ll mostly just be very personal
                        things, especially as someone who&#39;s very forgetful for what I even <i>like</i> sometimes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I&#39;ll be refining this page over time as I read more manifestos and properly word out my own
                        thoughts on things.
