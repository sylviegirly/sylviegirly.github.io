    Welcome to my insanity, if you're here, go get a sip of water. Anyway, feel free to
    peep at my (probably disorganized) coding!! Just don't 1:1 copy.

                        Nostalgia for MMOs
                    </h1>
                    <i>‚Äî April 30, 2025</i>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        Sighs, game nostalgia ... though mine usually always swirls around the old MMOs I used to play.
                        Well, one isn&#39;t even all that old, considering I only quit it just 1&ndash;2 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love <a href="https://elsword.koggames.com">Elsword</a> still as a game, but I miss the old
                        era of it, when the level cap wasn&#39;t 99, it was 60, when the newest character was my future
                        main LuCiel, when the graphics and UI were chunky and dungeons took 10 minutes to clear vs the 2
                        minutes they take now. And it sucks because the private servers I&#39;ve found rarely ever
                        capture the essence of that time in the 2012-2015 era (minus one I just <i>literally</i> found
                        that&#39;s <a href="https://www.classicels.com/">barely getting its legs as of April 25th</a>)
                        because most move to the modern game, which I dislike.

                    <p>
                        There&#39;s a tinge of nostalgia that lingers for that era of 2013 Elsword, and for the time I
                        used to play <a href="https://www.playpwi.com/en">Perfect World International</a> too, one which
                        has so many private servers that it&#39;s not hard to find one covering the classic era I played
                        it in (also in the 2010-2013 range), but unlike Elsword ... trying to play it ends up with me
                        just dropping it a couple of days later. Some servers allow you to boost to level cap, but I
                        don&#39;t see the joy in that when I never got to level cap and experienced endgame; to me, I
                        liked the idea of leveling and going through dungeons on my own, but even in private servers
                        that have a boost in EXP, it still unfortunately feels tedious and clunky and awkward!!!

                    <p>
                        And it makes me sad, because Perfect World International has SUCH a gorgeous landscape,
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/H0YuBmN6nNM">beautiful music</a> I still enjoy tenderly to this day,
                        and allowed you to take a mount and fly across the entire map if you wanted to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It&#39;s a nostalgia, but it&#39;s one that makes me sad to some degree because I wish I could
                        enjoy those games like I did when I was young, where I remember losing hours staying up late to
                        play and grind, with the guilds I used to be in ... and perhaps It&#39;s because I don&#39;t
                        have the people anymore that brought light to those games that makes it so much harder to get
                        back into them. I don&#39;t mind solo grinding, but a lot of my fun was in partaking in guild
                        PVP fights and running dungeons and just talking with people while playing dress-up with my cute
                        fox-girl summoner (funnily enough my nostalgia here was from a private server, I never got far
                        in the official game and instead opted to play long-term in a private server).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elsword I just straight up quit alongside my bestie, so that&#39;s less a case of
                        <i>community</i> and more a case that there aren&#39;t many private servers that cover the era
                        we both knew. Otherwise, the game as it is <b>sucks</b>, more in terms that raids and continual
                        enhancements have made the game a riddled, pay-to-win elitist mess, where if you decided to main
                        the &#39;wrong class&#39; people don&#39;t want you in the most recent raids (case in point, my
                        class was considered a sub-par DPS and only could work alongside a second DPS instead of
                        carrying a raid like other more <i>powerful</i> DPS classes, so I was shafted a lot when it came
                        to finding raid parties vs my friend who played a support that was always in demand ... and
                        since we were a duo pair, and we didn&#39;t go into separate parties, it made progressing in the
                        game stressful because of how people were about it).

                        I&#39;m glad FFXIV (even if on hiatus for me at the moment) fills a lot of that hole of an MMO I
                        can see myself dedicating time into ... and that I already have; although it cannot replace the
                        ache and longing for those games of the past, at least it can give me something new to pour
                        myself into.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although it makes me sad to think about sometimes, I&#39;m glad there are places trying to
                        preserve the older times, even if the people that made those times good are gone now, it
                        doesn&#39;t hurt to live a little bit of nostalgia before shelving it again.

                        (I realize this is the same case with Club Penguin for me, a deeply nostalgic game, but I can't
                        play it anymore like I used to because it's such a community centric game, and doing stuff on
                        your own is only so much fun)

                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        On the topic of ADHD ... it&#39;s still something I&#39;m rolling around in my brain; it&#39;s
                        only been in the last 6&ndash;8 months that I&#39;ve really settled with the idea that I may
                        most likely have inattentive ADHD ... I don&#39;t have a way of getting assessed for it (not
                        until I move out anyway), but my head has been deep into videos and research and what not, and
                        helping a friend realize she also most likely has it (and her scoring high on an actual
                        assessment test) also settled it in my own brain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It&#39;s kinda funny cause I&#39;ve had someone point out some posts I&#39;ve made (on tumblr)
                        align a lot with ADHD in the past, and I was there like &#39;haha it&#39;s a mood, but I
                        don&#39;t have it&#39; while also finding myself nodding and agreeing with other posts people
                        made about their ADHD/neurodivergent moods and experiences ... and while thinking &#39;yeah, I
                        feel that a lot, but I probably don&#39;t have it as bad as other people&#39;.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At least until I saw
                        <a href="https://sylviegirly.tumblr.com/post/765567124634763264">this post</a>
                        and something made it click in a way where I was like <i>&#39;oh&#39;</i>.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        class="full-width-image"
                        src="https://i.imgur.com/jJer7Fp.png"
                        alt="a tumblr screenshot, the first post writes: generally speaking when it comes to mental and physical health, if you're asked 'do you struggle with this' and your answer is 'no, Because I Have A System,' then your answer is actually yes" />
                    <p>
                        Because ... I&#39;ve had a lot of systems I put in place over the years. Reminders for my
                        &#39;subpar memory&#39; even for minor tasks like showering, setting tiny work amounts
                        (pomodoro), always relying on background noise, running timers for even small things like my tea
                        steeping, doing things on call with my friend, schedules, doing things half-way and at least
                        taking stride in that over nothing at all, subconscious fidgeting, putting things in easy access
                        and view, and probably other things I can&#39;t quite think of.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And it&#39;s funny because my long-term bestie of 8+ years now told me &#39;I always thought you
                        had it&#39; or something akin to basically having it like a red stamp on my forehead LOOOL. On
                        top of other people also pointing it out, and that the love and fixation I have for Sylvie is
                        definitely beyond the norm (for a normal, neurotypical person anyway). Obviously growing on the
                        internet, being fixated on your own OCs and fictional faves wasn&#39;t unusual to me so it&#39;s
                        why that didn&#39;t seem <i>weird</i> to me, and that normal not-online people either way
                        aren&#39;t weird about their own characters (if they even make any) but yeah. Never really
                        clicked.
                    </p>

                    <p>But it feels like an answer to a lot of things of how I am.</p>

                    <p>
                        My memory <i>is</i> terrible, yesterday blends into the past, and it&#39;s blurry. I remember
                        going to a cool food festival event with some coworkers and having the time of my life ... but
                        as soon as I get home/the next day, the event feels like it happened so long ago, like years.
                        Things don&#39;t feel real in particular, even though I know I was there, there&#39;s some weird
                        disconnect that I never really have been able to change. And I&#39;m sad because many fun events
                        I know I&#39;ve enjoyed myself at, I have no memories of if I never noted them down in some form
                        (pictures, writings), or if they were significant enough. And even those blend: ex. we&#39;ve
                        been to Cuba multiple times on vacation and I remember general strokes and chunks like me
                        finding a living starfish, but if you asked me which of those trips it was, I could not tell
                        you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I remembered a friend&#39;s birthday once because she shared it with my favourite fictional
                        character at the time, otherwise I need to write them down in my reminders to remember, even if
                        I love them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Time blindness is a <b>bitch</b>, and so is <b>task paralysis</b> (spinning random wheels/coin
                        flips are a nice solution for that).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am cursed to enjoy staring new projects and the hype and fixation rush (to be fair, this site
                        is one right now!!), but to not have the capability to carry most projects to their completion
                        without either working in a team, or having deadlines imposed on me with consequences due to
                        stress overwriting the ADHD part of the brain (I do not look at the amount of projects I began
                        around Sylvie, like a visual novel and RPG Maker game that are half done).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My thoughts are jumbled and messy and jump in places, I can go from topic to topic without
                        finding it weird, I like using my own experiences to connect to situations. To be fair,
                        recognizing that it most likely is ADHD that is causing this has helped me view things in a
                        different light. Why I struggle to want to start something, why I like having an item here but
                        not there, what works for my focus and when my focus is absolutely shot (I usually try to do
                        10&ndash;20 minutes of work even then, sometimes even just <i>starting</i> is enough to get me
                        to do a little more work than planned).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I tried to journal, but both physical and digital journals flopped for me (I know I do not have
                        to write in them every day, but if I don&#39;t try to keep consistency in some form, I then
                        forget to do the thing ... as soon as I slip, I usually stop doing it). Audio journaling has
                        been good to thought dump without feeling some looming pressure to write, or want to decorate,
                        and I don&#39;t feel the need to do it daily.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aside from that, I usually rely on my phone reminders and timers to keep some semblance of
                        organization in my life, and I like organizing things in other facets of my life to scratch an
                        itch (like this site, my tumblr blog, my Notion, etc).
                    </p>

                    <p>But here are some of the tools I&#39;ve liked to use:</p>

                            <a href="https://structured.app/">Structured</a> &mdash; a scheduling app, I use it on and
                            off, but I really like how it visualizes your free time + how your day is filled; it&#39;s
                            indie made as well
                        </li>

                            <a href="https://www.screenzen.co/">ScreenZen</a> &mdash; to avoid the time blindness
                            pitfall and to just help scrolling habits in general (or not getting lost in Cookie Run
                            games for 2&mdash;3 hours), also an indie app
                        </li>

                            <a href="https://www.untoldapp.com/">Untold</a>&nbsp;&mdash; my audio journaling app, sadly
                            only for iOS
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a>&nbsp;&mdash; I&#39;ve fallen off using Habitica
                            and already migrated my whole system to iOS&#39;s native Reminders, but it&#39;s honestly a
                            pretty good interactive habit tracker/to-do for those who&#39;d like a little RPG aspect to
                            it

                            anything I need to focus on intensely and don&#39;t want voices for (since otherwise I rely
                            on YouTube videos), case in point with me writing this blog

                        Not too sure what else to say outside of ... adult ADHD being hard to diagnose sucks!! I think I
                        know where mine came from if it is genetic (staring holes into my own dad), but it&#39;s
                        definitely not something like I feel like I can bring up with my own family. Thankfully the
                        online sphere is full of wonderful people, and information to see and get from people who
                        genuinely have it as well, so ... I am glad I&#39;ve learned a little more about myself and
                        understand myself a little better through it. Perhaps one day I can get a full confirmation
                        (hard not to have the lingering doubts about faking it eugh), but until then I learn what works
                        for me, and helps my brain a little more.

                        Hrrrr, well I guess it might be best to start the blogging page with err, <i>a blog</i>. It
                        might be a good way to also test out placing in images into actual article pages and see how
                        they function in the first place.

                        <b>And it works!!</b> Neat knowing block images can be centered with auto left/right margins.
                        Anyway, onto the actual blog post ... it&#39;s kinda hard cause when I do sit to think about
                        what I wanna write, I blank out; audio journalling has helped a lot on days I need to thought
                        dump (thanks <a href="https://www.untoldapp.com/">Untold</a> for that, very sad it&#39;s iOS
                        only) but it&#39;s rare that I <i>do</i> need to do it.

                    <p>
                        So blog posts here will probably be very sporadic, but I will try to document things to the best
                        of my ability, might it be something I&#39;m working on or learning.

                    <p>
                        Right now, I&#39;m definitely in the trenches with the last 2 weeks of school, considering
                        assignments are heavily piled on right now. I&#39;m not terribly worried since I&#39;ve got good
                        grades in all of my classes, and my projects that are heavier work (Unity ones) I managed to get
                        an extension on. I hate to admit that Copilot is perfect for coding prototype stuff
                        <b><u>really</u></b> fast, especially since my brain isn&#39;t a coder one (funny how I decided
                        to code a whole website then), and it&#39;s been easing up a lot of the stress I&#39;ve had with
                        this game project. Making curling into a VR game is ... <i>weird</i>, but I&#39;ve got an idea,
                        and it&#39;s slowly shaping into something more solid. Thankfully, it&#39;s only a prototype, so
                        I&#39;m not going super in-depth.

                        The other is just interactables, and it might take me more to make some shitty and quick
                        ProBuilder models to do a base colour on, vs just having physics based items you interact with
                        to simulate the tea-making industrial process (which surprisingly is still very hands-on, this
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqDk2swTiB8">wonderful video</a> by Wu Mountain Tea is
                        what I&#39;m going to base it off, and probably do the oolong tea process in a more simplified
                        version.

                    <p>
                        Aside from that, working on this site has helped me to understand HTML/CSS better, though
                        Javascript is still a mystifying beast to me. Most likely because I know nothing about the
                        syntax they use for functions and things. Like I understand at a vague level (duh, I had C#
                        drilled into my brain for years in Game Design), but otherwise ... icky, <i>spooky</i>. Still a
                        lot to do, and I&#39;m very stumped on how I wanna handle OC profiles. It might be the one
                        instance where I do make a different CSS layout just for OCs and place them in a folder to
                        figure that out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Otherwise, I do hope to get some work done on that because I wanna join the yume ring that&#39;s
                        here, but it requires a completed shrine. I guess if I think about it, shrines are also ways to
                        make new CSS/HTML layouts for something you like to dedicate to it. I do really like ... yeah
                        yeah, it is <b>homogenizing</b>, but I do like consistency across the look of a website for
                        anything that isn&#39;t a special page. I have mad respect for the people who can make new
                        layouts for pages, cause I definitely could never (both in energy and my brain fighting against
                        it). Part of me wonders if I can just reuse my &lt;intro&gt; and &lt;aside&gt; sections and
                        modify them with my existing CSS, but also blehhhh. If there&#39;s a code that allows you to
                        &#39;merge&#39; columns (aka have one div that spans two of your defined columns) I might be
                        able to just use my old CSS, but some part of me also just wants to say fuck it and just make an
                        altered version only for OCs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I do have <a href="https://toyhou.se/">Toyhouse</a> for all of them, and I prefer that as my OC
                        hub for hosting everything + uploading all of my art and commissions, but I think it&#39;d be so
                        cool to make something a little more custom (I say as if my layout isn&#39;t inspo&#39;d by the
                        CSS layout I have on there, which speaking of I should credit in my footer as inspo). I most
                        likely will end up doing the same for my character layouts, or see what other people have done
                        on here, or see if any existing templates I can adjust/gut to work with my current CSS ...
                        anyway, plans and plans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I should be playing the new HSR update, but I&#39;ve been <i>so</i> sucked into either website
                        work, or school work. Hell, even poor Minecraft got left behind which was my fixation ... but
                        that&#39;s it for now!! Till next time I get brainworms I need to offload.
